@article{Churikov2001,
abstract = {The kinetics of lithium electrochemical systems is governed by the transport processes in the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) coating the lithium anode. The present work studies the temperature effect on the electrochemical kinetics of a metallic lithium electrode immersed into a LiClO4solution in propylene carbonate in a wide polarization range. A series of polarization curves of the Li electrode within a temperature range of -35 to +70°C were recorded using the pulse voltammetry method. Any of these symmetrical anodic and cathodic polarization curves looks as a segment of a straight line (the Ohmic current j$\Omega$caused by the intrinsic ionic conductivity of SEI) shading, as the overpotential $\eta$ rises, into a power curve jinj∝ $\eta$n(jinjbeing the injection current) with a temperature-dependent exponent n ≥ 2. Similar polarization curves were recorded for the Li electrode in LiClO4and LiBF4solutions in $\gamma$-butyrolactone as well. The cause of such a j($\eta$, T) dependence is assumed to be structural disordering of the SEI material resulting in the appearance of a distribution of jump distances and energy barrier height for charge carriers. The stochastic transport of carriers in a disordered solid with a wide distribution of site-to-site jump times leads, by calculation of the current-voltage dependence, to the above power function jinj∝ $\eta$nwith an exponent depending on the absolute temperature T as n = 1 + (a1- b1/T)-2. Our experimental data are in good agreement with this model. Comparing the experimental j - $\eta$ curves with the theoretical equations, one could estimate a set of the microscopic parameters of transfer, including the mean jump distance, the effective radius of charge localization, the jumping attempt frequency, and the mean height of energy barriers. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

@article{Mukherjee2012,
abstract = {This work is part of a bigger project which aims to research the potential development of commercial opportunities for the re-use of batteries after their use in low carbon vehicles on an electricity grid or microgrid system. There are three main revenue streams (peak load lopping on the distribution Network to allow for network re-enforcement deferral, National Grid primary/ secondary/ high frequency response, customer energy management optimization). These incomes streams are dependent on the grid system being present. However, there is additional opportunity to be gained from also using these batteries to provide UPS backup when the grid is no longer present. Most UPS or ESS on the market use new batteries in conjunction with a two level converter interface. This produces a reliable backup solution in the case of loss of mains power, but may be expensive to implement. This paper introduces a modular multilevel cascade converter (MMCC) based ESS using second-life batteries for use on a grid independent industrial plant without any additional onsite generator as a potentially cheaper alternative. The number of modules has been designed for a given reliability target and these modules could be used to minimize/eliminate the output filter. An appropriate strategy to provide voltage and frequency control in a grid independent system is described and simulated under different disturbance conditions such as load switching, fault conditions or a large motor starting. A comparison of the results from the modular topology against a traditional two level converter is provided to prove similar performance criteria. The proposed ESS and control strategy is an acceptable way of providing backup power in the event of loss of grid. Additional financial benefit to the customer may be obtained by using a second life battery in this way.},

@article{Ustun2011,
abstract = {Climate change concerns due to the rising amounts of the carbon gas in the atmosphere have in the last decade or so initiated a fast pace of technological advances in the renewable energy industry. Such developments in technology and the move towards cleaner sources of energy have made distributed generation (DG) from renewable resources more desirable. However, it is a known fact that rising penetrations of DG can have adverse impacts on the grid structure and its operation. The microgrid concept is a solution proposed to control the impact of DG and make conventional grids more suitable for large scale deployments of DG. Covering many aspects of the power systems and power electronics fields, microgrids have become a very popular research field. This paper reviews the background and the concept of a microgrid, the current status of the literature, on-going research projects, and the relevant standards. It also presents a review of the microgrid pilot projects around the world in further detail and discusses the potential avenues for further research. ?? 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This article presents a model-based monitoring approach for the internal resistance dependent state-of-health (SOH) of a high power lithium-ion battery cell used in hybrid electric vehicles. The monitoring method requires only signals which are already available in vehicles by measurement during regular driving. As varying battery temperatures occur during vehicle operation, a monitoring method has to cover the usual operation range from 0 C to 50 C. For this, a battery cell model from the class of linear parameter-varying (LPV) models is identified from measurement data. In contrast to many publications, the proposed monitoring method is validated using cell measurement data from driving cycles. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Although today's Li-ion technology has conquered the portable electronic markets and is still improving, it falls short of meeting the demands dictated by the powering of both hybrid electric vehicles and electric vehicles or by the storage of renewable energies (wind, solar). There is room for optimism as long as we pursue paradigm shifts while keeping in mind the concept of materials sustainability. Some of these concepts, relying on new ways to prepare electrode materials via eco-efficient processes, on the use of organic rather than inorganic materials or new chemistries will be discussed.

abstract = {A phenomenological Li-ion cell degradation model, pertaining to charge-discharge cyclic fatigue, is proposed and validated. It is known that Solid Electrolyte Inter-phase (SEI) formation on the particle surfaces consumes active Li leading to capacity loss. The problem is further aggravated by the creation of fresh surfaces by the fracture that develops as a result of intercalation induced stresses. In addition, fracture could result in isolation of chunks of electrode material or SEI could electronically isolate certain electrode material zones, both essentially rendering the active Li or electrode material ineffective.The degradation leads to increase in electronic resistance and decrease of ionic conductivity as well as diffusivity. Central to the model is a parameter expressed as the normalized reaction surface area, diminishing with charge-discharge cycles. Here, we develop phenomenological evolution expressions for the Fracture, SEI formation and Isolation, and incorporate them in Newman's Porous Composite Electrode framework. The model is implemented in the battery module of COMSOL. Notably, the utility of a lumped parameter ‘?SOC*SOCmean', based on the State of Charge (SOC) is brought out.},

abstract = {The primary current-collector materials being used in lithium-ion cells are susceptible to environmental degradation: aluminum to pitting corrosion and copper to environmentally assisted cracking. Localized corrosion occurred on bare aluminum electrodes dur- ing simulated ambient-temperature cycling in an excess of electrolyte. The highly oxidizing potential associated with the positive- electrode charge condition was the primary factor. The corrosion mechanism differed from the pitting typically observed in aque- ous electrolytes because each site was filled with a mixed metal/metal-oxide product, forming surface mounds or nodules. Elec- trochemical impedance spectroscopy was shown to be an effective analytical tool for characterizing the corrosion behavior of alu- minum under these conditions. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses, little difference existed in the composition of the surface film on aluminum and copper after immersion or cycling in LiPF6 electrolytes made with two different solvent formu- lations. Although Li and P were the predominant adsorbed surface species, the corrosion resistance of aluminum may simply be due to its native oxide. Finally, copper was shown to be susceptible to environmental cracking at or near the lithium potential when specific metallurgical conditions existed (work hardening and large grain size).},

A novel converter topology which has three ports: 12 kV ac, 22 kV dc and 400 V dc for future hybrid ac and dc microgrid systems is presented in this paper. Each port has the capability of bi-directional power flow which is required in future hybrid ac and dc microgrids. The 400 V dc bus, which is connected to distributed energy resources, injects/draws power to/from both the ac grid and the dc grid through solid-state transformers. The topology avoids the use of line-frequency transformers which are considered to be expensive and bulky. Because the hybrid converter is connected to both the ac grid and the dc grid, enhanced reliability is achieved.

The adsorber/desorber heat exchanger contains 13.2 kg of zeolite 13X and is connected to an evaporator/condenser heat exchanger via a butterfly valve. The flow rate of the heat transfer fluid in the adsorber/desorber unit has been changed between 0.5 and 2.0 l min?1, the inlet temperature to the evaporator between 10 and 408C. It turned out that the higher the flow rate inside the adsorber/desorber unit the faster and more effective is the discharge of heat. However, at lower flow rates higher discharge temperatures are obtained. Storage capacities of 2.7 and 3.1kWh have been measured at the evaporator inlet temperatures of 10 and 408C, respectively, corresponding to thermal energy storage densities of 80 and 92kWhm?3 based on the volume of the adsorber unit. The measured maximum power density increases from 144 to 165kWhm?3 as the flow rate in the adsorber increases from 0.5 to 2 l min?1.

The partial-differential algebraic equations (PDAEs) constituting the model are spatially discretised using Chebyshev orthogonal collocation enabling fast and accurate simulations up to high C-rates. This implementation of the pseudo-2D model is then used in combination with an extended Kalman filter algorithm for differential-algebraic equations to estimate the states of the model. The state estimation algorithm is able to rapidly recover the model states from current, voltage and temperature measurements. Results show that the error on the state estimate falls below 1{\%} in less than 200 s despite a 30{\%} error on battery initial state-of-charge and additive measurement noise with 10 mV and 0.5 K standard deviations.},

abstract = {Three-dimensional transient thermal analyses of an air-cooled module that contains prismatic lithium-ion cells operating under an aggressive driving profile were performed using a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. The existing module utilized air cooling through evenly-spaced channels on both sides of each cell. It was found that lowering the gap spacing and/or higher flow rate of the fan lead to a decrease of the maximum temperature rise. To achieve improved temperature uniformity over the module, the gap spacing should be of a moderate size. For the given module, operating with a uniform gap spacing of 3 mm and an air flow rate of 40.8 m3 h-1 appears to be the best choice that satisfies the trade-off requirements of the fan power, maximum temperature rise and temperature uniformity. Using the same gap spacing and air flow rate, a proposed design of one-side cooling is less effective than two-side cooling. Uneven gap spacing affects the temperature distributions, but it does not impact the maximum temperature rise markedly. Considering the variety of the design change options and their combinations, it is concluded that the temperature gradients along the air flow direction can be affected but are generally unavoidable. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This article presents an approach for balancing serially connected battery strings with high efficiency energy transferred. The efficiency of this balancing process is accomplished by channeling an excess energy through a DC Link Bus rather than done serially. Using this proposed technique with converter which was 80 percent efficiency, the equalized efficiency of balancing process is increased more than the conventional techniques at least 12.80 percent. By applied this proposed technique to the charge equalized system, the unbalance charging problem can be eliminated. The validity of this approach can be supported by computer simulation and experimental result.},

An initialization subroutine, DAEIS (Differential Algebraic Equation Initialization Subroutine), has been developed to handle this issue. In DAEIS, consistent initial values of dependent variables fo index-1 DAEs are obtained through solving a set of nonlinear equations based on the initialization settings. To achieve good efficiency and robustness of the initialization computation, a nonlinear equation solver, GNES, has been specially built for DAEIS. The usage of DAEIS is demonstrated through handling inconsistent initializations for combined continuous/discrete simulations. {\textcopyright}Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper develops a mathematical model for lithium intercalation and phase change in an iron phosphate-based lithium-ion cell in order to understand the cause for the low power capability of the material. The juxtaposition of the two phases is assumed to be in the form of a shrinking core, where a shell of one phase covers a core of the second phase. Diffusion of lithium through the shell and the movement of the phase interface are described and incorporated into a porous electrode model consisting of two different particle sizes. Open-circuit measurements are used to estimate the composition ranges of the single-phase region. Model-experimental comparisons under constant current show that ohmic drops in the matrix phase, contact resistances between the current collector and the porous matrix, and transport limitations in the iron phosphate particle limit the power capability of the cells. Various design options, consisting of decreasing the ohmic drops, using smaller particles, and substituting the liquid electrolyte by a gel are explored, and their relative importance discussed. The model developed in this paper can be used as a means of optimizing the cell design to suit a particular application.},

abstract = {The electrochemical performance of a composite of nano-Si powder and a pyrolytic carbon of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with carbon nanofiber (CNF) was examined as an anode for lithium-ion batteries. CNF was incorporated into the composite by two methods; direct mixing of CNF with the nano-Si powder coated with carbon produced by pyrolysis of PVC (referred to as Si/C/CNF-1) and mixing of CNF, nano-Si powder, and PVC with subsequent firing (referred to as Si/C/CNF-2). The external Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area of Si/C/CNF-1 was comparable to that of Si/C/CNF-2. The micropore BET surface area of Si/C/CNF-2 (73.86 m2 g-1) was extremely higher than that of Si/C/CNF-1 (0.74 m2 g-1). The composites prepared by both methods exhibited high capacity and excellent cycling stability for lithium insertion and extraction. A capacity of more than 900 mA h g-1 was maintained after 30 cycles. The coulombic efficiency of the first cycle for Si/C/CNF-1 was as low as 53{\%}, compared with 73{\%} for Si/C/CNF-2. Impedance analysis of cells containing these anode materials suggested that the charge transfer resistance for Si/C/CNF-1 was not changed by cycling, but that Si/C/CNF-2 had high charge transfer resistance after cycling. A composite electrode prepared by mixing Si/C/CNF-2 and CNF exhibited a high reversible capacity at high rate, excellent cycling performance, and a high coulombic efficiency during the first lithium insertion and extraction cycles. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier B.V.

Although the errors could be just sign typos (which can be explained as carelessness in the use of d/d. x versus d/d. n, with n the outward unit vector) and authors using this model probably use the correct boundary condition when they solve it in order to do simulations, readers should be aware of the right choice. Therefore, the deduction of the correct boundary condition is done here, and a mathematical study of the well-posedness of the corresponding problem is presented.},

An overview of the state-of-the-art of SoC indication methods including available market solutions from leading semiconductor companies, e.g. Texas Instruments, Microchip, Maxim, is given in the first part of this book. Furthermore, a universal SoC indication system that enables 1{\%} or better accuracy under all realistic user conditions is developed.

abstract = {A strong asymmetric rate behavior between lithiation and delithiation has been observed in amorphous Si (a-Si) anode in the form of thin films, but not in other geometries, such as Si nanospheres. This work investigated the rate behavior of the two geometries through numerical simulations. The results reveal that the rate behavior is affected by the geometry and the constraint of the electrode, the chemo-mechanical coupling, and the prior process. A substrate-constrained film has a relatively low surface/volume ratio and a constant surface area. Its lithiation has a great tendency to be hindered by surface limitation. The chemo-mechanical coupling also plays an important role. The stress profiles differ in the two geometries but both affect the lithiation process more than the delithiation process. The overall delithiation capacity is affected very little by the chemo-mechanical coupling. In cyclic loading, the delithiation capacity is reduced at the same rate as the lithiation capacity because of the low initial state of charge in the electrode. The asymmetric rate behavior was absent under cyclic loading. On the other hand, a slow charging process resulted in a better retained delithiation capacity and an asymmetric rate behavior at higher rates.},

@article{ploehn,
abstract = {This work presents a rigorous continuum mechanics model of solvent diffusion describing the growth of solid-electrolyte interfaces (SEIs) in Li-ion cells incorporating carbon anodes. The model assumes that a reactive solvent component diffuses through the SEI and undergoes two-electron reduction at the carbon-SEI interface. Solvent reduction produces an insoluble product, resulting in increasing SEI thickness. The model predicts that the SEI thickness increases linearly with the square root of time. Experimental data from the literature for capacity loss in two types of prototype Li-ion cells validates the solvent diffusion model. We use the model to estimate SEI thickness and extract solvent diffusivity values from the capacity loss data. Solvent diffusivity values have an Arrhenius temperature dependence consistent with solvent diffusion through a solid SEI. The magnitudes of the diffusivities and activation energies are comparable to literature values for hydrocarbon diffusion in carbon molecular sieves and zeolites. These findings, viewed in the context of recent SEI morphology studies, suggest that the SEI may be viewed as a single layer with both micro- and macroporosity that controls the ingress of electrolyte, anode passivation by the SEI, and cell performance during initial cycling as well as long-term operation. 2004 The Electrochemical Society.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2016 IEEE.A series of switched-capacitor (SC) cell balancing circuits is proposed for rechargeable energy storage devices like battery and supercapacitor strings in this paper. Taking a basic SC-based cell balancing unit as an equivalent resistor, the behavioral models of the proposed cell balancing circuits are developed to evaluate their balancing performance. Comparing with existing SC-based cell balancing circuits, the main advantage of the proposed circuits is that their balancing speed is independent of both of the number of battery cells and initial mismatch distribution of cell voltages. In order to improve the operation performance of SC-based cell balancing circuits in the respect of minimizing the equivalent resistance, optimizing methodologies of circuit parameters are introduced by referring the concepts of slow switching limit and fast switching limit as well as inductive switching limit of SC power converters. Simulation and experimental results are provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed cell balancing circuits.},

Comprehensive Summaries of Uppsala Dissertations from the Faculty of Science and Technology 651. 53 pp. Uppsala. ISBN 91-554-5100-4. LiMn2O4 is ideal as a high-capacity Li-ion battery cathode material by virtue of its low toxicity, low cost, and the high natural abundance of Mn. Surface related reactions and bulk kinetics have been the major focus of this work. The main techniques exploited have been: electrochemical cycling, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and thermal analysis. Interface formation between the LiMn2O4 cathode and carbonate-based electrolytes has been followed under different pre-treatment conditions. The variables have been: number of charge/discharge cycles, storage time, potential, electrolyte salt and temperature. The formation of the surface layer was found not to be governed by electrochemical cycling. The species precipitating on the surface of the cathodes at ambient temperature have been determined to comprise a mixture of organic and inorganic compounds: LiF, LixPFy (or LixBFy, depending on the electrolyte salt used), LixPOyFz (or LixBOyFz) and poly(oxyethylene). Additional compounds were found at elevated temperatures: phosphorous oxides (or boron oxides) and polycarbonates. A model has been presented for the formation of these surface species at elevated temperatures. The cathode surface structure was found to change towards a lithium-rich and Mn3+-rich compound under self-discharge. The reduction of LiMn2O4, in addition to the high operating potential, induces oxidation of the electrolyte at the cathode surface. A novel in situ electrochemical/structural set-up has facilitated a study of the kinetics in the LiMn2O4 electrode. The results eliminate solid-phase diffusion as the rate-limiting factor in electrochemical cycling. The electrode preparation method used results in good utilisation of the electrode, even at high discharge rates.},

The battery-pack was charged at 2.36 A and provided 55-W constant power during discharge. Results showed the battery-pack has reasonable heat dissipation capability except that the temperature rise of its charge control IC increases to 67 ??C, which is near the critical thermal limit of the device (73-75 ??C). Autopsy results showed this IC has a small die to die-pad size ratio and also large volume of mold compound causing the device self-heating during the charge control process. Thermal modeling provided a detailed understanding of the thermal response of the battery under various operating conditions that helped to reduce the product design cycle-time. The overall results indicated that the battery temperature rise during charge is dominated by the power dissipation from the control electronics and during discharge by the heat dissipation from Li-ion cells. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {A pulse-width-modulated (PWM) inverter using the Walsh function
harmonic elimination method is proposed in this paper. By using the
Walsh domain waveform analytic technique, the harmonic amplitudes of the
inverter output voltage can be expressed as functions of switching
angles. Thus, the switching angles are optimized by solving linear
algebraic equations instead of solving nonlinear transcendental
equations. The local piecewise linear relations between the switching
angles and the fundamental amplitude can be obtained under an
appropriate initial condition. By searching all feasible initial
conditions, the global solutions are obtained. The relations between
switching angles and fundamental amplitude can be approximated by
straight-line curve fitting. Thus, on-line control of fundamental
amplitude and frequency is possible for the microcomputer-based
implementation. The developed algorithm can be applied to both bipolar
and unipolar switching schemes. The theoretical predictions are
confirmed by computer simulations and DSP-based hardware implementation

Using a single cell model, which was validated against experimental data and demonstrated with validity of high accuracy in predicting cell performance, we showed that such a high accuracy in single cell model is essential for a high fidelity pack simulation. It is also important to derive statistical confidence intervals accurately from experiments to characterize intrinsic cell-to-cell variations in capacity and internal resistance, which need to be considered in the pack model. If parameters for each individual cell were correctly approximated and used in the pack model, the accuracy in the prediction of pack performance could be significantly improved. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We develop a simulation model that aims to evaluate the effect of thermal management on battery life. The model consists of two sub- models: a thermal model and a battery degradation model. The temperature rise in the battery is calculated using the thermal model, and a temperature profile is obtained under pre-defined driving, charging and stand-by scenarios. The temperature profile and the energy requirement required to achieve a driving profile act as inputs to the degradation sub-model, which is used to predict the battery life. The degradation model is derived from models and test data available in literature, and the model is constructed for air- cooled cylindrical LiFePO4 cells based on the Hymotion Prius-conversion configuration. Preliminary results suggest that peak temperatures have the greatest impact on degradation: Thermal management increases life substantially in climates with high peak temperatures (Pheonix) and for more aggressive driving cycles (US06), while thermal management has less influence in climates with lower peak temperatures (Miami) and with gentle driving cycles (UDDS). Use of cabin air vs. outside air for thermal management has minor impact on battery life for the control strategy used, but thermostat control settings are important for lowering peak temperatures and extending battery life.},

Although thermoelectric devices are attractive, its efficiency is limited by the relatively low figure-of-merit and low-temperature differential. An alternative approach is to explore thermodynamic cycles. Thermogalvanic effect, the dependence of electrode potential on temperature, can construct such cycles. In one cycle, an electrochemical cell is charged at a temperature and then discharged at a different temperature with higher cell voltage, thereby converting heat to electricity. Here we report an electrochemical system using a copper hexacyanoferrate cathode and a Cu/Cu(2+) anode to convert heat into electricity. The electrode materials have low polarization, high charge capacity, moderate temperature coefficients and low specific heat. These features lead to a high heat-to-electricity energy conversion efficiency of 5.7{\%} when cycled between 10 and 60 °C, opening a promising way to utilize low-grade heat.},

Two cell chemistries were studied, a Baseline chemistry that had a cathode composition of LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 with binders, that was cycle-life tested at 25 and 45 °C, and a Variant C chemistry with a cathode composition of LiNi0.8Co0.10Al0.10O2 with binders, that was tested only at 45 °C. The 300 Wh power, and {\%} power fade were determined as a function of test time, i.e. the number of test cycles for up to 44 weeks (369,600 test cycles) for the Baseline cells, and for 24 weeks (201,600 test cycles) for the Variant C cells. The C/1 and C/25 discharge capacity and capacity fade were also determined during the course of these studies. The results of this study indicate that the 300 Wh power for the Baseline cells tested at 25 °C (up to 44 weeks of testing) decreased as a linear function of test time. The {\%} power fade for these cells increased as a linear function of test time. The Baseline cells tested at 45 °C (up to 44 weeks of testing) displayed a decrease in their power proportional to the square root of the test time, with a faster rate of decrease of the power occurring at ∼28 weeks of testing. The {\%} power fade for these cells also increased as the square root of the test time, and exhibited an increase in the {\%} power fade rate at ∼28 weeks of testing. The 45 °C tested Baseline cells' power decreased, and their {\%} power fade increased at a greater rate than the 25 °C tested Baseline cells. The power fade was greater for the Variant C cells. The power of the Variant C cells (tested at 45 °C) decreased as the square root of the test time, and their {\%} power fade was also found to be a function of the square root of the test time (up to 24 weeks of testing), i.e. the rate of decrease in the power and the increase in the {\%} power fade rate was greater for the Variant C cells than for the Baseline cells also tested at 45 °C. The C/1 and C/25 Ah capacities of the Baseline cells tested at 25 and 45 °C were determined to be a function of the square root of the cycle time (i.e. number of test cycles) for test times up to 44 weeks. The capacity fade was greater at 45 °C than at 25 °C. Similarly, the C/1 and C/25 charge capacities of the Variant C cells were found to be a function of the square root of the test time (up to 24 weeks of testing). The C/1 and C/25 charge capacities decreased as a function of test time and the rate of decrease was smaller for the Variant C cells as compared to the Baseline cells over comparable test times (24 weeks).

abstract = {A performance comparison of SiC MOSFETs and JFETs in a high-power (1kW) DC-DC converter to form part of a single phase PV inverter system is presented. The drive design requirements for optimum performance in the energy conversion system are also detailed. The converter which is based on 1.2 kV 20A SiC switches and 600 V 8A SiC diodes was tested under continuous conduction mode at frequencies up to 250 kHz. The converter power efficiency, switch power loss and temperature measurements are then compared with the ultra high speed CoolMOS switches and SiC diodes. The high voltage, high frequency and high temperature operation capability of the SiC DUTs are also demonstrated. Increasing the frequency from 100 kHz to 250 kHz resulted in case temperatures of up to 191°C and an observed decrease in efficiency from 95{\%} to 92.5{\%} for the CoolMOS. The all SiC converters showed more stable efficiencies of 95.5{\%} and 96{\%} for the switching frequency range for the SiC MOSFET and JFET, respectively. A comparison of radiated noise showed the highest noise signature for the SiC JFET and lowest for the SiC MOSFET. The negative gate voltage requirement of the SiC MOSFET introduces up to 6 dB{\$}\mu{\$}V increase in radiated noise, due to the induced current in the high frequency resonant stray loop in the gate drive negative power plane.},

abstract = {In today's world, there is a continuous global need for more energy which, at the same time, has to be cleaner than the energy produced from the traditional generation technologies. This need has facilitated the increasing penetration of distributed generation (DG) technologies and primarily of renewable energy sources (RES). The extensive use of such energy sources in today's electricity networks can indisputably minimize the threat of global warming and climate change. However, the power output of these energy sources is not as reliable and as easy to adjust to changing demand cycles as the output from the traditional power sources. This disadvantage can only be effectively overcome by the storing of the excess power produced by DG-RES. Therefore, in order for these new sources to become completely reliable as primary sources of energy, energy storage is a crucial factor. In this work, an overview of the current and future energy storage technologies used for electric power applications is carried out. Most of the technologies are in use today while others are still under intensive research and development. A comparison between the various technologies is presented in terms of the most important technological characteristics of each technology. The comparison shows that each storage technology is different in terms of its ideal network application environment and energy storage scale. This means that in order to achieve optimum results, the unique network environment and the specifications of the storage device have to be studied thoroughly, before a decision for the ideal storage technology to be selected is taken. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Cycle life is critically important in applications of rechargeable batteries, but lifetime prediction ismostly based on empirical trends, rather than mathematical models. In practical lithium-ion batteries, capacity fade occurs over thousands of cycles, limited by slow electrochemical processes, such as the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) in the negative electrode, which compete with reversible lithium intercalation. Focusing on SEI growth as the canonical degradation mechanism, we show that a simple single-particle model can accurately explain experimentally observed capacity fade in commercial cells with graphite anodes, and predict future fade based on limited accelerated aging data for short times and elevated temperatures. The theory is extended to porous electrodes, predicting that SEI growth is essentially homogeneous throughout the electrode, even at high rates. The lifetime distribution for a sample of batteries is found to be consistent with Gaussian statistics, as predicted by the single-particle model.We also extend the theory to rapidly degrading anodes, such as nanostructured silicon, which exhibit large expansion on ion intercalation. In such cases, large area changes during cycling promote SEI loss and faster SEI growth. Our simple models are able to accurately fit a variety of published experimental data for graphite and silicon anodes.},

The equivalent circuit for such a mosaic-type SEI electrode is extremely complex. It is shown that near room temperature the grain-boundary resistance (R96) for polyparticle solid electrolytes is larger than the bulk ionic resistance. Up to now, all models of SEt electrodes ignored the contribution of R6b to the overall SEI resistance. We show here that this neglect has no justification. On the basis of recent results, we propose here for SEI electrodes equivalent circuits which take into account the contribution of grain-boundary and other interfacial impedance terms. This model accounts for a variety of different types of Nyquist plots reported for lithium and LiC6 electrodes in liquid nonaqueous and polymer electrolytes.},

In this article, we present a novel theory for the long term evolution of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) in lithium-ion batteries and propose novel validation measurements. Both SEI thickness and morphology are predicted by our model as we take into account two transport mechanisms, i.e., solvent diffusion in the SEI pores and charge transport in the solid SEI phase. We show that a porous SEI is created due to the interplay of these transport mechanisms. Different dual layer SEIs emerge from different electrolyte decomposition reactions. We reveal the behavior of such dual layer structures and discuss its dependence on system parameters. Model analysis enables us to interpret SEI thickness fluctuations and link them to the rate-limiting transport mechanism. Our results are general and independent of specific modeling choices, e.g., for charge transport and reduction reactions.},

abstract = {Over the last decade, many efforts have been deployed to develop models for the prediction, the control, the optimization and the parameter estimation of Lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. It appears that the most successful electrochemical-based model for Li-ion battery is the Pseudo-two-Dimensional model (P2D). Due to the fact that the governing equations are complex, this model cannot be used in real-time applications like Battery Management Systems (BMSs). To remedy the situation, several investigations have been carried out to simplify the P2D model. Mathematical and physical techniques are employed to reduce the order of magnitude of the P2D governing equations. The present paper is a review of the studies on the modeling of Li-ion batteries with simplified P2D models. The assumptions on which these models rest are stated, the calculation methods are examined, the advantages and the drawbacks of the models are discussed and their applications are presented. Suggestions for overcoming the shortcomings of the models are made. Challenges and future directions in the modeling of Li-ion batteries are also discussed.},

abstract = {A physics-based side-reaction coupled electrochemical model for capacity fade of a graphite/LiMn2O4 cell is developed by including the key degradation mechanisms in both anode and cathode. The side reactions considered in this study include 1) solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth and manganese deposition on the anode and 2) manganese dissolution, electrolyte oxidation and salt decomposition on the cathode. Our study reveals three stages of capacity fade upon long term cycling: acceleration, stabilization, and saturation. In the acceleration stage, capacity fade is due mainly to the cyclable lithium loss induced by the anode SEI growth. In the stabilization stage, the anode SEI growth slows down as it gets thicker, the cathode Mn dissolution-induced capacity loss outpaces cyclable lithium loss, and the cathode becomes more intercalated at the end of discharge. In the saturation stage, cathode capacity degrades further and becomes the limiting factor, the cyclable lithium is shifted to the anode and the cathode reaches end-of-discharge saturation due to the severe cathode capacity fade. This study shows that the cyclable lithium loss and the cathode capacity loss are the two major contributors to the cell capacity fade, and the interaction between them determines the cell capacity.},

abstract = {Portable underwater electrical power is needed for many commercial, recreational and military applications. A battery system is currently not available to meet these needs, which was the aim of this project. Lithium-ion battery cells (Panasonic (CGR18650E)) were chosen, based on their high energy density and availability. To increase their voltage, 8 battery cells were connected in series ("sticks") and protected by encapsulating them into a polycarbonate tube; and 6 sticks were housed inside a triangular aluminum case (module). Testing was performed to determine the consistency of individual cells, sticks and module and during discharge/charging cycles. The effect of ambient temperature (TA) was determined by instrumenting them with thermocouples. In addition, voltage and current were measured and used to determine the heat generated within the battery cell and were compared to theory. From these data, a radial temperature profile was determined for two battery sticks in the battery module. Collapse pressure was determined and compared to theory. The Panasonic (CGR18650E) cells delivered 2291 mAh each over a wide range of TA and discharge/charge rates. The theoretical and experimental data showed that the temperature within the battery sticks and modules did not rise above or below their operating temperature range (-20 and 60 ??C), in agreement with the models. The tubes encapsulating the sticks withstood pressures down to 305 m of sea water (msw) which was predicted by modeling. The Panasonic (CGR18650E) cells, sticks and module demonstrated that they provided sufficient electrical power, reliably and safely to be used in the underwater environment (1800-2000 kPa, 305 msw) over a wide range T A, including high power requirement systems like an active thermal protection system that keeps a diver comfortable in extreme temperature conditions. The concept developed here can be modified to meet specific power requirements by varying the number of cell in series to achieve the desired voltage, and the number of sticks in parallel to provide the current capacity required. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Batteries are the key technology for enabling further mobile electrification and energy storage. Accurate prediction of the state of the battery is needed not only for safety reasons, but also for better utilization of the battery. In this work we present a state estimation strategy for a detailed electrochemical model of a lithium-ion battery. The benefit of using a detailed model is the additional information obtained about the battery, such as accurate estimates of the internal temperature, the state of charge within the individual electrodes, overpotential, concentration and current distribution across the electrodes, which can be utilized for safety and optimal operation. Based on physical insight, we propose an output error injection observer based on a reduced set of partial differential-algebraic equations. This reduced model has a less complex structure, while it still captures the main dynamics. The observer is extensively studied in simulations and validated in experiments for actual electric-vehicle drive cycles. Experimental results show the observer to be robust with respect to unmodeled dynamics as well as to noisy and biased voltage and current measurements. The available state estimates can be used for monitoring purposes or incorporated into a model based controller to improve the performance of the battery while guaranteeing safe operation.},

The interactions between the fluid pore pressure diffusion and the elastic/viscoelastic rock matrix deformation are illustrated via two important examples. First, the problem of a borehole subject to a non-hydrostatic stress state, but deforming under plane strain condition, is examined. Second, a cylinder under generalized plane strain conditions is solved. Three rocks, Berea Sandstone, Danian Chalk, and a deep water Gulf of Mexico Shale, covering a wide range of permeabilities, are considered.

They look at influence of orientation of heat pipe (e.g. car going up hill) -shows that performance is reduced, but doesn't explore how to resolve this.

However, the phase angle of the high frequency resonant inverters output voltage can not be controlled with conventional phase shift modulation or pulse width modulation. The phase angle is a function of both the phase of the gating signals and the impedance of the resonant tank. In this paper, we proposed a pulse phase modulation (PPM) concept for the resonant inverter, so that the phase angle of the resonant inverter output voltage can be regulated. The PPM can be used to minimize the circulating current in a multiple resonant inverter system. The mechanism of the PPM was explained and analyzed.

The battery designs were based upon the lithium-ion cell composition designated Gen-2 in the US Department of Energy Advanced Technology Development Program. The worst-case cooling requirement that would occur during prolonged aggressive driving was estimated to be 250 W or about 5 W per cell for a 48-cell battery. Rapid heating of the battery from a very low startup temperature is more difficult than cooling during driving. A dielectric transformer fluid is superior to air for both heating and cooling the battery. A dedicated refrigeration system for cooling the battery coolant would be helpful in maintaining low temperature during driving. The use of ample insulation would effectively slow the battery temperature rise when parking the vehicle in warm weather. Operating the battery at 10??C during the first several years when the battery has excess power would extend the battery life. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

For some applications, where the power frequencies are high (above some 10 or 100 Hz) it is possible to filter the high frequencies using passive components; yet this results in additional costs. In other applications, where the dynamic time constants are in the range up to some seconds, filtering cannot be done. Batteries are hence operated with the dynamic loads. But what happens under these dynamic operation conditions? This paper describes the fundamentals of the dynamic characteristics of batteries in a frequency range from some MHz down to the mHz range. As the dynamic behaviour depends on the actual state of charge (SOC) and the state of health (SOH), it is possible to gain information on the battery state by analysing the dynamic behaviour. High dynamic loads can influence the battery temperature, the battery performance and the battery lifetime. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this study, the calendar aging of lithium-ion batteries is investigated at different temperatures for 16 states of charge (SoCs) from 0 to 100{\%}. Three types of 18650 lithium-ion cells, containing different cathode materials, have been examined.Our study demonstrates that calendar aging does not increase steadily with the SoC. Instead, plateau regions, covering SoC intervals of more than 20{\%}–30{\%} of the cell capacity, are observed wherein the capacity fade is similar. Differential voltage analyses confirm that the capacity fade is mainly caused by a shift in the electrode balancing. Furthermore, our study reveals the high impact of the graphite electrode on calendar aging. Lower anode potentials, which aggravate electrolyte reduction and thus promote solid electrolyte interphase growth, have been identified as the main driver of capacity fade during storage. In the high SoC regime where the graphite anode is lithiated more than 50{\%}, the lowanode potential accelerates the loss of cyclable lithium, which in turn distorts the electrode balancing. Aging mechanisms induced by high cell potential, such as electrolyte oxidation or transition-metal dissolution, seem to play only a minor role. To maximize battery life, high storage SoCs corresponding to low anode potential should be avoided.},

The effect of negative turn-off gate drive voltage is also taken into account in the modeling. In order to reflect the low-temperature characteristics of SiC MOSFET accurately, low temperature (-25 �C) measurements are carried out, which provide the modeling basis. The determinations of key parameters in the model are analyzed in detail, including the on-state resistor, internal gate resistor, temperature dependent sources, and some capacitors. The proposed model is verified by the experimental tests on a buck converter prototype at different input voltages, input currents, and temperatures. Simulation results on the proposed model coincide well with the experimental test results, in terms of switching waveforms and power losses even at low temperature (-25 �C).

Different degrees of continuous discharge were imposed on the cells to mimic afternoon V2G use to displace grid electricity. The loss of battery capacity was quantified as a function of driving days as well as a function of integrated capacity and energy processed by the cells. The cells tested showed promising capacity fade performance: more than 95{\%} of the original cell capacity remains after thousands of driving days worth of use.

abstract = {Energy storage (ES) integration into the grid is typically achieved by using single-stage converters interconnected to long series connected strings of battery cells. Such configurations are susceptible to reliability issues as no mechanism exists to address failure of individual battery cells. DC bus fault currents are also excessively large in such systems, which degrades safety and adds complexity to protection systems. This paper examines the modularized integration of ES into the grid by exploiting the modular nature of modular multilevel converters (MMCs). The power balance analysis in this paper demonstrates the ability of a MMC to integrate ES while addressing the short-comings of existing solutions. In the proposed topology, the ES is subdivided into banks, where each bank is integrated into an individual MMC submodule. This both reduces current conduction losses within the MMC submodules and simultaneously provides a mechanism for isolating ES banks from both ac and dc side fault events. This paper focuses on determining the robustness of the proposed ES enabled MMC structure to failure, overheating or over-charge/discharge of individual ES banks. It is shown that as many as 30{\%} of ES banks may be shut-down without affecting MMC power exchange with the grid. In cases where ES banks are operable in less than 70{\%} of modules, it is shown that auxiliary controls may be introduced to facilitate continued MMC power exchange with the grid. This is achieved through reactive current circulation within the MMC structure.},

The aim is to be able to predict the end-of-discharge (EOD) event that indicates that the battery pack has run out of charge for any given flight of an electric UAV platform. The amount of usable charge of a battery for a given discharge profile is not only dependent on the starting state-of-charge (SOC), but also other factors like battery health and the discharge or load profile imposed. This problem is more pronounced in battery powered electric UAVs since different flight regimes like takeoff/landing and cruise have different power requirements and a dead stick condition (battery shut off in flight) can have catastrophic consequences. Since UAVs deployments are relatively new, there is a lack of statistically significant flight data to motivate data-driven approaches. Consequently, we have developed a detailed discharge model for the batteries used and used it in a Bayesian inference based filtering (Particle Filtering) technique to generate remaining useful life (RUL) distributions for a given discharge.

abstract = {The three level buck converter can offer high efficiency and high power density in VR and POL applications. The gains are made possible by adding a flying capacitor that reduces the MOSFET voltage stress by half allowing for the use of low voltage devices, doubles the effective switching frequency, and decreases the inductor size by reducing the volt-second across the inductor. To achieve high efficiency and power density the flying capacitor must be balanced at half of the input voltage and the circuit must be started up without the MOSFETs seeing the full input voltage for protection purposes. This paper provides a new novel control method to balance the flying capacitor with the use of current control and offers a simple startup solution to protect the MOSFETs during start up. Experimental verification shows the efficiency gains and inductance reduction.},

These studies included spectroscopic measurements (FTIR, XPS, EDAX), morphological and structural analysis (XRD, SEM, AFM) in conjunction with impedance spectroscopy, EQCM and standard electrochemical techniques. It appears that the performance of both Li, Li-C anodes and LixMOycathodes depends on their surface chemistry in solutions.

Several common classical phenomena occurring in these systems are reviewed and discussed.},

Former operation strategies made use of voltage limits only to protect the battery against deep discharge and overcharge. Currently, battery operation is changing to what could rather be called battery management than simply protection. For this improved battery control, the battery SOC is a key factor. Much research work has been done in recent years to improve SOC determination. Operational conditions differ for batteries in, for example, photovoltaic applications, (hybrid)-electric vehicles or telecommunications. Hence, a given method for SOC calculation will be more suitable for a certain application than for another. The authors introduce commonly used methods for SOC determination and establish a relationship between the advantages of the different methods and the most common applications. As a main illustration, the analysis of Kalman filter technique for lead-acid battery SOC determination are presented and some results for other calculation methods as well. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {As a result of growing markets for electric vehicles and residential batteries for buffering energy from photovoltaics, the number of grid-integrated lithium-ion batteries has been continuously increasing in the past years. Apart from their primary purpose, these batteries may also be employed to provide services to the power grid in terms of peak shaving or frequency regulation. The profitability of such services for the battery owner, however, remains a controversial issue. Particularly battery degradation resulting from increased energy throughput is discussed as a major impediment for profitable operation. This paper presents a scheduling approach which considers the non-linear dependencies of battery aging from various operation parameters along with real-time prices and price forecasts for computing optimal charging/dispatching schedules. The methodology is applied to price-data obtained from four different electricity markets. The investigation partly confirms existing profitability concerns but further shows that explicit consideration of battery degradation can yield profitable outcomes. Various scenarios using aggregated and locational marginal prices as well as different forecasting horizons and time resolutions are explored to identify favorable operating conditions. {\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.},

In the model, the effect of the phase transformation on concentration variation, stress evolution and stress discontinuity is clarified. In addition, it has been found that concentration jumps result in hoop stress discontinuities, which can lead to crack at the interface. Then, the stress intensity factor is derived from the interface crack innano electrodes during galvanostatic charging. The stress intensity factors obtained indicate that interface crack will not propagate when stress intensity factor is less than the fracture toughness of electrode materials during lithiation. Significantly, failure mechanics criterion diagram with critical nanoparticle electrode size and current density is arrived. The present model maybe used to help the structural design for electrodes in lithium ion batteries.},

abstract = {A fault leading to a thermal runaway in a lithium-ion battery is believed to grow over time from a latent defect. Significant efforts have been made to detect lithium-ion battery safety faults to proactively facilitate actions minimizing subsequent losses. Scaling up a battery greatly changes the thermal and electrical signals of a system developing a defect and its consequent behaviors during fault evolution. In a large-capacity system such as a battery for an electric vehicle, detecting a fault signal and confining the fault locally in the system are extremely challenging. This paper introduces a fail-safe design methodology for large-capacity lithium-ion battery systems. Analysis using an internal short circuit response model for multi-cell packs is presented that demonstrates the viability of the proposed concept for various design parameters and operating conditions. Locating a faulty cell in a multiple-cell module and determining the status of the fault's evolution can be achieved using signals easily measured from the electric terminals of the module. A methodology is introduced for electrical isolation of a faulty cell from the healthy cells in a system to prevent further electrical energy feed into the fault. Experimental demonstration is presented supporting the model results. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Intercalation-induced stress and heat generation inside Li-ion battery cathode LiMn2O4 particles under potentiodynamic control are simulated in this paper. We combined analyses of transport and kinetics in determining resulting stresses, which arise from concentration gradients in cathode particles, and heat generation. Two peaks in boundary reaction flux, and resulting stresses, were determined from the modeling of electrochemical kinetics and diffusion, using intrinsic material properties resulting in two plateaus in the open-circuit potential and the applied potential. Resistive heating was identified as the most important heat generation source. To probe the impact of the particle shape equivalent radius and aspect ratio of an ellipsoidal particle and the potential sweep rate on stress and heat generation, a surrogate-based analysis was also conducted. The systematic study showed that both intercalation-induced stress and time-averaged resistive heat generation rate increase with particle radius and potential sweep rate. Intercalation-induced stress increases first, then decreases as the aspect ratio of an ellipsoidal particle increases, whereas time-averaged resistive heat generation rate decreases as aspect ratio increases. This surrogate-based analysis suggests that ellipsoidal particles with larger aspect ratios are preferred over spherical particles, in improving battery performance when stress and heat generation are the only factors considered.},

In order to gain a more profound understanding of the role of the electrolyte, properties such as the Li salt diffusion coefficient, the Li+ transference number, and the Li salt activity all need to be measured in addition to the conductivity. The situation is further complicated by the fact that high currents change the cell temperature and also create strong concentration gradients in the electrolyte. A full set of transport properties for LiPF6 in a propylene carbonate/ethylene carbonate/dimethyl/carbonate mixture were measured as a function of temperature and LiPF6 concentration. The Li+ transference number was found to be fairly constant with concentration. The activity and diffusion coefficient were both found to vary strongly with temperature and concentration. The temperature dependence of the transport properties is shown to be crucial for making predictions of cell performance at high currents.},

abstract = {This paper presents a numerical calculation of the evolution of the spatially resolved solid concentration in the two electrodes of a lithium-ion cell. The microscopic solid concentration is driven by the macroscopic Butler–Volmer current density distribution, which is consequently driven by the applied current through the boundary conditions. The resulting, mostly causal, implementation of the algebraic differential equations that describe the battery electrochemical principles, even after assuming fixed electrolyte concentration, is of high order and complexity and is denoted as the full order model. The full order model is compared with the results in the works of Smith and Wang (2006, “Solid-State Diffusion Limitations on Pulse Operation of a Lithium-Ion Cell for Hybrid Electric Vehicles,” J. Power Sources, 161, pp. 628–639) and Wang (2007 “Control oriented 1D Electrochemical Model of Lithium Ion Battery,” Energy Convers. Manage., 48, pp. 2565–2578) and creates our baseline model, which will be further simplified for charge estimation. We then propose a low order extended Kalman filter for the estimation of the average-electrode charge similarly to the single-particle charge estimation in the work of White and Santhanagopalan (2006, “Online Estimation of the State of Charge of a Lithium Ion Cell,” J. Power Sources, 161, pp. 1346–1355) with the following two substantial enhancements. First, we estimate the average-electrode, or single-particle, solid-electrolyte surface concentration, called critical surface charge in addition to the more traditional bulk concentration called state of charge. Moreover, we avoid the weakly observable conditions associated with estimating both electrode concentrations by recognizing that the measured cell voltage depends on the difference, and not the absolute value, of the two electrode open circuit voltages. The estimation results of the reduced, single, averaged electrode model are compared with the full order model simulation.},

Compared with other simulation methodologies, the phase-field method has been widely applied in the solidification modeling that has great relevance to SET formation. The developed model can simulate SET structure and morphology evolution, and can predict SET thickness growth rate. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) experiments are performed to confirm the major SET species as LiF, Li2O, ROLi, and ROCO2Li. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiment is performed to present the SET layer structures. The experiments reduce the complexity of the model development and provide validation to some extent. Fick's law and mass balance are applied to investigate lithium-ion concentration distributions and diffusion coefficients in different types of SEI layers predicted by the phase-field simulations. Simulation results show that lithium-ion diffusion coefficients between 298 K and 318K are 1.340-7.328(10(-16)) cm(2)/s, 1.734-3.405(10(-12)) cm(2)/s, and 2.611-2.389(10(-15)) cm(2)/s in the compact, porous, and multilayered structures of SET layer, respectively.

abstract = {Carbon coating of silicon powder was studied as a means of preparation of silicon-based anode material for lithium ion batteries. Carbon-coated silicon has been investigated at various cycling modes vs. lithium metal. Ex situ X-ray data suggest that there is irreversible reduction of crystallinity of the silicon content. Since carbon layer preserving the integrity of the particle, the reversibility of the structural changes in the amorphous state Li-Si alloy provides the reversible capacity. The progressively decreased Coulomb efficiency with cycling indicates that more and more lithium ions are trapped in some form of Li-Si alloy and become unavailable for extraction. This is the main factor for the capacity fading during cycling. Qualitative studies of the impedance spectra of the electrode material at the first cycle for the fresh anode and at the last cycle after the anode capacity faded considerably and provide further support for this model of fading mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The problem is analysed using a model that makes use of a multiscale continuum description of the battery electrode and specifically accounts for the viscoelastic properties of the binder [9]. This model predicts the evolution of the stress fields in the binder in response to: (i) binder swelling due to electrolyte absorption during cell assembly, and; (ii) shrinkage and growth of the electrode particles during cell cycling. The model predictions provide a cogent explanation for morphological damage seen in microscopy images of real cathodes. The effects of altering electrode particle shape, binder rheology and cycling rates on binder delamination are all investigated and used to make suggestions on how electrode lifetimes could be extended.},

abstract = {Degradation in lithium ion (Li-ion) battery cells is the result of a complex interplay of a host of different physical and chemical mechanisms. The measurable, physical effects of these degradation mechanisms on the cell can be summarised in terms of three degradation modes, namely loss of lithium inventory, loss of active positive electrode material and loss of active negative electrode material. The different degradation modes are assumed to have unique and measurable effects on the open circuit voltage (OCV) of Li-ion cells and electrodes. The presumptive nature and extent of these effects has so far been based on logical arguments rather than experimental proof. This work presents, for the first time, experimental evidence supporting the widely reported degradation modes by means of tests conducted on coin cells, engineered to include different, known amounts of lithium inventory and active electrode material. Moreover, the general theory behind the effects of degradation modes on the OCV of cells and electrodes is refined and a diagnostic algorithm is devised, which allows the identification and quantification of the nature and extent of each degradation mode in Li-ion cells at any point in their service lives, by fitting the cells' OCV.},

abstract = {Battery cell life depends critically on how the cell is used. Therefore, battery chargers and battery management systems must be designed to control cell usage carefully. In order to design optimal battery controls that effect a tradeoff between cell performance (in some sense) and cell life, a model of cell degradation is necessary. This model must be simple and incremental in order to be implemented by an inexpensive microcontroller. This paper takes a first step toward developing such a controls-oriented comprehensive cell degradation model by deriving a reduced-order model of a single mechanism: the growth process of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, along with the resulting resistance rise and capacity loss. This reduced-order model approximates a physics-based PDE model from the literature, is simple and accurate, and may be used in optimal strategies for controlling lithium-ion batteries. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Impedance spectroscopy is one of the most promising methods for characterizing aging effects of portable secondary batteries online because it provides information about different aging mechanisms. However, application of impedance spectroscopy “in the field” has some higher requirements than for laboratory experiments. It requires a fast impedance measurement process, an accurate model applicable with several batteries and a robust method for model parameter estimation. In this paper, we present a method measuring impedance at different frequencies simultaneously. We propose to use a composite electrode model, capable to describe porous composite electrode materials. A hybrid method for parameter estimation based on a combination of evolution strategy and Levenberg–Marquardt method allowed a robust and fast parameter calculation. Based on this approach, an experimental investigation of aging effects of a lithium ion battery was carried out. After 230 discharge/charge cycles, the battery showed a 14{\%} decreased capacity. Modeling results show that series resistance, charge transfer resistance and Warburg coefficient changed thereby their values by approximately 60{\%}. A single frequency impedance measurement, usually carried out at 1kHz, delivers only information about series resistance. Impedance spectroscopy allows additionally the estimation of charge transfer resistance and Warburg coefficient. This fact and the high sensitivity of model parameters to capacity change prove that impedance spectroscopy together with an accurate modeling deliver information that significantly improve characterization of aging effects.},

@article{Kozlowski,
abstract = {Traditional impedance measurement techniques rely heavily on
taking voltage measurements to obtain the internal impedance of
batteries. Because of the very low impedance, voltage output signals
will be very low as well. These voltage sources require high gain
amplification and, with the combination of low volt signals and low
input impedance to the amplifier, there is a high susceptibility to
noise and EMI. Also, sensitivity of the measurement is directly related
to the impedance of the battery. As battery cells get larger and larger,
the internal impedance gets smaller and smaller. The voltage
measurements in turn get smaller as well as reducing the sensitivity of
the measuring circuit. Increasing the input current is one way of
improving the output signal but this would require moving from amps to
tens of amps of current to drive the circuit. Frequently occurring
online measurements at such high current not only puts a higher power
requirement on the circuit but injects more energy into the battery.
This potentially contributes to heating and disrupting normal cell
reactions and in turn distorts the measurement accuracy. The technique
presented in this paper uses only current measurements and very low
excitation current (patent pending). A description of the technique is
given and compared to other common configurations. Experimental data was
collected using the novel circuit design along with the 4-wire method.
This data was collected from two different battery sizes and chemistries
(lead-acid, nickel-cadmium). Different tests were conducted: in the
presents of EMI, offline, and online under various loading conditions

abstract = {The performance loss of lithium-ion batteries with lithium iron phosphate positive chemistry was analyzed using electrochemical characterization techniques such as galvanostatic charge–discharge at different rates, ac impedance, and hybrid pulse power characterization measurements. Differentiation analysis of the discharge profiles as well as in situ reference electrode measurement revealed loss of lithium as well as degradation of the carbon negative; the cell capacity, however, was limited by the amount of active lithium. Destructive physical analyses and ex situ electrochemical analyses were performed at test completion on selected cells. While no change in positive morphology and performance was detected, significant cracking and delamination of the carbon negative was observed. In addition, X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the changes in the crystal structure of the graphite during cycling. The degradation of the carbon negative is consistent with the observations from the electrochemical analysis. Ex situ electrochemical analysis confirmed that active lithium controlled cell capacity and its loss with cycling directly correlated with cell degradation. The relationship between carbon negative degradation and loss of active lithium is discussed in the context of a consistent overall mechanism.},

We attempt to clarify what is meant by capacity loss and cyclable lithium loss by defining these terms in the context of electrode state-of-charge restrictions. We define irreversible capacity loss as that associated with active material loss and define two types of reversible capacity loss associated with balanced and unbalanced side reactions. We also examine several methods of compensating for cyclable lithium loss associated with passive-film formation and calculate the effect each has on a cell's specific energy. Preforming the negative electrode, adding cyclable lithium to the positive electrode, and introducing lithium powder into the negative electrode appear to be the most attractive methods in terms of specific energy, but practical constraints such as fabrication cost must be evaluated to determine which is superior.},

The reuse of PHEV/EV propulsion batteries in second use applications following the end of their automotive service life may have the potential to offset the high initial cost of these batteries today. Accurately assessing the value of such a strategy is exceedingly complex and entails many uncertainties. This paper takes a first step toward such an assessment by estimating the impact of battery second use on the initial cost of PHEV/EV batteries to automotive consumers and exploring the potential for grid-based energy storage applications to serve as a market for used PHEV/EV batteries. It is found that although battery second use is not expected to significantly affect today's PHEV/EV prices, it has the potential to become a common component of future automotive battery life cycles and potentially to transform markets in need of cost-effective energy storage.

abstract = {A (time-dependent) model for an electrochemical cell, comprising a dilute binary electrolytic solution between two flat electrodes, is formulated. The method of matched asymptotic expansions (taking the ratio of the Debye length to the cell width as the small asymptotic parameter) is used to derive simplified models of the cell in two distinguished limits and to systematically derive the ButlerVolmer boundary conditions. The first limit corresponds to a diffusion-limited reaction and the second to a capacitance-limited reaction. Additionally, for sufficiently small current flow/large diffusion, a simplified (lumped-parameter) model is derived which describes the long-time behaviour of the cell as the electrolyte is depleted. The limitations of the dilute model are identified, namely that for sufficiently large half-electrode potentials it predicts unfeasibly large concentrations of the ion species in the immediate vicinity of the electrodes. This motivates the formulation of a second model, for a concentrated electrolyte. Matched asymptotic analyses of this new model are conducted, in distinguished limits corresponding to a diffusion-limited reaction and a capacitance-limited reaction. These lead to simplified models in both of which a system of PDEs, in the outer region (the bulk of the electrolyte), matches to systems of ODEs, in inner regions about the electrodes. Example (steady-state) numerical solutions of the inner equations are presented.},

Evolution of open-circuit potential shows a qualitative trend consistent with other methods, but does not yield reasonable estimates of film thickness or porosity. Impedance results are less effective at extracting unique characterization parameters than steady-state methods but have major experimental advantages over rotating-disk electrode measurements.},

abstract = {The fundamental frequency component in the arm currents of a modular multilevel converter is a necessity for the operation of the converter, as is the connection and bypassing of the submodules. Inevitably, this will cause alternating components in the capacitor voltages. This paper investigates how the arm currents and capacitor voltages interact when the submodules are connected and bypassed in a sinusoidal manner. Equations that describe the circulating current that is caused by the variations in the total inserted voltage are derived. Resonant frequencies are identified and the resonant behaviour is verified by experimental results. It is also found that the effective values of the arm resistance and submodule capacitances can be extracted from the measurements by least square fitting of the analytical expressions to the measured values. Finally, the analytical expression for the arm currents is verified by experimental results.},

The crevice is modelled as a parallel-sided slot filled with a dilute sodium chloride solution. The cavity propagation rates are found to be faster in the case of a crevice with passive walls than one with active walls. The distribution of current over the internal surface of a crevice with corroding walls can be assessed using this model, giving an indication of the future shape of the cavity. The model is extended to include a solid hydroxide precipitation reaction and considers the effect of consequent changes in the chemical and physical environment within the crevice on the predicted corrosion rates.

These include: battery state-of-charge, power fade, capacity fade, and instantaneous available power. The estimation mechanism must adapt to changing cell characteristics as cells age and therefore provide accurate estimates over the lifetime of the pack. In a series of three papers, we propose methods, based on extended Kalman filtering (EKF), that are able to accomplish these goals for a lithium ion polymer battery pack. We expect that they will also work well on other battery chemistries. These papers cover the required mathematical background, cell modeling and system identification requirements, and the final solution, together with results. This third paper concludes the series by presenting five additional applications where either an EKF or results from EKF may be used in typical BMS algorithms: initializing state estimates after the vehicle has been idle for some time; estimating state-of-charge with dynamic error bounds on the estimate; estimating pack available dis/charge power; tracking changing pack parameters (including power fade and capacity fade) as the pack ages, and therefore providing a quantitative estimate of state-of-health; and determining which cells must be equalized.

abstract = {We have previously described algorithms for a battery management system (BMS) that uses Kalman filtering (KF) techniques to estimate such quantities as: cell self-discharge rate, state-of-charge (SOC), nominal capacity, resistance, and others. Since the dynamics of electrochemical cells are not linear, we used a non-linear extension to the original KF called the extended Kalman filter (EKF). We were able to achieve very good estimates of SOC and other states and parameters using EKF. However, some applications e.g., that of the battery-management-system (BMS) of a hybrid-electric-vehicle (HEV) can require even more accurate estimates than these. To see how to improve on EKF, we must examine the mathematical foundation of that algorithm in more detail than we presented in the prior work to discover the assumptions that are made in its derivation. Since these suppositions are not met exactly in BMS application, we explore an alternative non-linear Kalman filtering techniques known as "sigma-point Kalman filtering" (SPKF), which has some theoretical advantages that manifest themselves in more accurate predictions. The computational complexity of SPKF is of the same order as EKF, so the gains are made at little or no additional cost. The SPKF method as applied to BMS algorithms is presented here in a series of two papers. This first paper is devoted primarily to deriving the EKF and SPKF algorithms using the framework of sequential probabilistic inference. This is done to show that the two algorithms, which at first may look quite different, are actually very similar in most respects; also, we discover why we might expect the SPKF to outperform EKF in non-linear estimation applications. Results are presented for a battery pack based on a third-generation prototype LiPB cell, and compared with prior results using EKF. As expected, SPKF outperforms EKF, both in its estimate of SOC and in its estimate of the error bounds thereof. The second paper presents some more advanced algorithms for simultaneous state and parameter estimation, and gives results for a fourth-generation prototype LiPB cell. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

However, since conventional topologies are based on multiple individual dc-dc converters, the required switch count increases proportionally to the number of modules connected in series, increasing the complexity. A two-switch voltage equalizer using an LLC resonant inverter and voltage multiplier is proposed in this paper. The circuitry can be dramatically simplified compared with conventional topologies due to the two-switch configuration. Detailed operation analyses for the LLC resonant inverter and voltage multiplier are separately performed. Experimental equalization tests emulating partially shaded conditions were performed for four PV modules connected in series. With the proposed voltage equalizer, local MPPs successfully disappeared, and extractable maximum power increased compared with those without equalization, demonstrating the effectiveness and performance of the proposed voltage equalizer.},

abstract = {In a lithium-ion cell, heat generation and temperature evolution during operation pose a significant bearing on the mechanical degradation and cell performance. The thermal implications on the electrode mechano-electrochemical behavior have been elucidated. Crack formation due to diffusion-induced stress in the active particles has been analyzed. Temperature dependence of the mechano-physicochemical parameters has been taken into account. Total amount of diffusion-induced damage has been estimated for different current density, ambient temperature and particle size. For subzero temperatures, adiabatic operation can boost the cell performance significantly. Increased mechanical degradation has been observed for high C-rate and larger particle sizes. Decreasing ambient temperature results in aggravated crack formation resulting in severe capacity loss. However, at subzero temperatures and under high C-rate conditions, significant concentration gradient exists near the active particle peripheral region resulting in reduced damage penetration. The cell performance analysis reveals that the impact of mechanical degradation on the capacity loss is most prominent at subzero temperatures. The effect of cycling shows accelerated damage in the first few cycles followed by a plateau in the damage evolution. Existence of a critical particle size for maximum damage has been suggested which depends significantly on the cell temperature.},

The model is then used to maximize the specific energy of the cell by optimizing the design for a fixed time of discharge. The cell was optimized for the porosity and thickness of the positive electrode, while holding constant the capacity ratio of the two electrodes, the thickness and porosity of the separator, the electrolyte concentration, and the porosity of the negative electrode. The effect of the capacity ratio was qualitatively examined. The optimization was performed for discharge times ranging from 10 h to 2 min in order to map the maximum performance of this chemistry under a wide operating range. The study allows us to gauge the ability of this chemistry to be used in a particular application.

abstract = {Electrode degradation in LiFePO4/mesocarbon microbead graphite (MCMB) pouch cells aged at 55 °C by a synthetic hybrid drive cycle or storage is diagnosed and put into context with previous results of aging at 22 °C. The electrode degradation is evaluated by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), measured separately on electrodes harvested from the cells, and by using a physics-based impedance model for aging evaluation. Additional capacity measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) are used in the evaluation. At 55 °C the LiFePO4 electrode shows increased particle/electronic conductor resistance, for both stored and cycled electrodes. This differs from results obtained at 22 °C, where the electrode suffered lowered porosity, particle fracture, and loss of active material. For graphite, only cycling gave a sustained effect on electrode performance at 55 °C due to lowered porosity and changes of surface properties, and to greater extent than at low temperature. Furthermore, increased current collector resistance also contributes to a large part of the pouch cell impedance when aged at increased temperatures. The result shows that increased temperature promotes different degradation on the electrode level, and is an important implication for high temperature accelerated aging.

abstract = {The paper describes the application of a real- time, adaptive battery modelling methodology to Li-ion batteries. This methodology allows accurate estimation of the State-of-Function (SoF) of batteries for an Electric or Hybrid-Electric vehicle. Through use of a Kalman Estimator and online battery model parameter estimation, the voltages associated with monitoring the State of Charge (SoC) of the battery system are shown to be accurately estimated, even given erroneous initial conditions in both the model and parameters. In this way, problems such as self-discharge during non-use of the cells and SoC drift (as usually incurred by coulomb-counting methods due to over- charging or ambient temperature fluctuations) are overcome. A further benefit of the adaptive nature of the parameter estimation allows battery ageing (State of Health - SoH) to be monitored and, in the case of safety-critical systems, cell failure may be predicted in time to avoid inconvenience to passenger networks. Moreover, the ability to accurately predict the SoF and changes in battery parameters allows charging scenarios to be optimized to extend lifetime and facilitate future “Vehicle-to-Grid” (V2G) implementation.},

abstract = {As an anode active material, Si experiences large deformations during battery cycling, which has been cited as a primary cause for the electrode fracture and thus capacity fading. The problems caused by the electrode deformations can be remedied through electrode design, and the numerical models will greatly facilitate this design process. However, the lack of key material properties for Si/LixSi, especially the Li diffusivity in Si, has prevented the efficient use of such numerical tools in the design of lithium-ion batteries with Si anodes. In this work, finite element (FE) analysis was used to study the Li diffusivity in amorphous Si (a-Si) anodes. To simulate the large deformation, a large strain based formulation for the concentration induced volume expansion was proposed. The Li diffusion and volume expansion were coupled and solved in COMSOL Multiphysics{\textregistered}. By comparing with the lithiation experimental observations for the a-Si nanospheres, the Li diffusivity was estimated to be on the order of 2.0×10-15m2/s for the Li-rich phase and 2.0×10-17m2/s for the Li-poor phase. These values were further validated by comparing the thickness growth of the Li-rich phase and the lithiation time.},

abstract = {In this paper, the thermal runaway features of a 25 Ah large format prismatic lithium ion battery with Li(NixCoyMn z)O2 (NCM) cathode are evaluated using the extended volume-accelerating rate calorimetry (EV-ARC). 4 thermocouples are set at different positions of the battery. The temperature inside the battery is 870 C or so, much higher than that outside the battery. The temperature difference is calculated from the recorded data. The temperature difference within the battery stays lower than 1 C for 97{\%} of the test period, while it rises to its highest, approximately 520 C, when thermal runaway happens. The voltage of the battery is also measured during the test. It takes 15-40 s from the sharp drop of voltage to the instantaneous rise of temperature. Such a time interval is beneficial for early warning of the thermal runaway. Using a pulse charge/discharge profile, the internal resistance is derived from the quotient of the pulse voltage and the current during the ARC test. The internal resistance of the battery increases slowly from 20 m?? to 60 m?? before thermal runaway, while it rises to 370 m?? when thermal runaway happens indicating the loss of the integrity of the separator or the battery swell.?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

To describe RES and the operating conditions of their components it is useful to define categories of similar operating conditions.

Our study focuses on the performance of the carbon negative electrode, which is composed of TIMREX SFG synthetic graphite material of varying particle size distribution. All cells showed high discharge and comparatively low charge rate capability. Up to the 20 C rate, discharge capacity retention of more than 96{\%} was found for SFG6. The rate capability of the half-cells is a function of both the particle size distribution of the graphite material and the preparation method of the electrode. A transport limitation model is proposed to explain the restrictions of the high current performance of graphite electrodes. The key parameters found to influence the performance of a graphite negative electrode were the loading, the thickness, and the porosity of the electrode. -� 2005 The Electrochemical Society.

abstract = {Alloying anodes such as silicon are promising electrode materials for next-generation high energy density lithium-ion batteries because of their ability to reversibly incorporate a high concentration of Li atoms. However, alloying anodes usually exhibit a short cycle life due to the extreme volumetric and structural changes that occur during lithium insertion/extraction; these transformations cause mechanical fracture and exacerbate side reactions. To solve these problems, there has recently been significant attention devoted to creating silicon nanostructures that can accommodate the lithiation-induced strain and thus exhibit high Coulombic efficiency and long cycle life. In parallel, many experiments and simulations have been conducted in an effort to understand the details of volumetric expansion, fracture, mechanical stress evolution, and structural changes in silicon nanostructures. The fundamental materials knowledge gained from these studies has provided guidance for designing optimized Si electrode structures and has also shed light on the factors that control large-volume change solid-state reactions. In this paper, we review various fundamental studies that have been conducted to understand structural and volumetric changes, stress evolution, mechanical properties, and fracture behavior of nanostructured Si anodes for lithium-ion batteries and compare the reaction process of Si to other novel anode materials.},

Accurate prediction of the state of the battery is needed not only for safety reasons, but also for better utilization of the battery. In this work we present a state estimation strategy for a detailed electrochemical model of a lithium-ion battery. The benefit of using a detailed model is the additional information obtained about the battery, such as accurate estimates of the state of charge within the individual electrodes, overpotential, concentration and current distribution across the electrodes, which can be utilized for safety and optimal operation. We propose an observer based on a reduced set of partial differential-algebraic equations, which are solved on a coarse spatial grid. The reduced model has a less complex structure, while still capturing the main dynamics. The observer is tested in experiments for actual electric-vehicle drive cycles. Experimental results show the observer to be robust with respect to unmodeled dynamics, as well as to noisy and biased voltage and current measurements. The available state estimates can be used for monitoring purposes, or incorporated into a model based controller to improve the performance of the battery while guaranteeing safe operation.},

Given that DNNs are now able to classify objects in images with near-human-level performance, questions naturally arise as to what differences remain between computer and human vision. A recent study revealed that changing an image (e.g. of a lion) in a way imperceptible to humans can cause a DNN to label the image as something else entirely (e.g. mislabeling a lion a library). Here we show a related result: it is easy to produce images that are completely unrecognizable to humans, but that state-of-the-art DNNs believe to be recognizable objects with 99.99{\%} confidence (e.g. labeling with certainty that white noise static is a lion). Specifically, we take convolutional neural networks trained to perform well on either the ImageNet or MNIST datasets and then find images with evolutionary algorithms or gradient ascent that DNNs label with high confidence as belonging to each dataset class. It is possible to produce images totally unrecognizable to human eyes that DNNs believe with near certainty are familiar objects. Our results shed light on interesting differences between human vision and current DNNs, and raise questions about the generality of DNN computer vision.},

abstract = {The design of a resonant inverter for high-frequency ac (HFAC) power distribution systems is complicated by the following three factors: 1) A number of electronic loads located in different locations are connected to the resonant inverter, the impedance, and the power factor of the equivalent load of which varies over a wider range than a system with a certain load; 2) the resonant inverter is subject to an input-line voltage varying over a wide range; and 3) the characteristics of the resonant inverter depend on the load impedance. It is mandatory to operate the inverter with zero-voltage switching under various load conditions of different power factors and over wide input variations. It is further desirable that multiple resonant inverters can be paralleled with simple current-sharing control (CSC). A phase-shift- modulation (PSM)-controlled full-bridge series-parallel resonant inverter is proposed for the HFAC power distribution architectures. A new PSM method is proposed with which the phase angle of the inverter output voltage is independent of the modulation signal of the phase-shift modulator. Such a feature allows multiple resonant inverters to operate in parallel with a magnitude CSC. The resonant inverter is analyzed with a general nonresistive load model, and the design curves are developed. A prototype resonant inverter system is designed and implemented with an operation frequency of 1 MHz, a rated output power of 150 W, and a sinusoidal output voltage of 1-MHz 28-V rms. The proposed resonant inverter has the advantages of high efficiency over wide input/output line variations, high waveform quality of the output voltage, and phase-angle independence of the voltage-feedback/feed-forward control and CSC.},

abstract = {We reformulate and extend porous electrode theory for non-ideal active materials, including those capable of phase transformations. Using principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we relate the cell voltage, ionic fluxes, and Faradaic charge-transfer kinetics to the variational electrochemical potentials of ions and electrons. The Butler-Volmer exchange current is consistently expressed in terms of the activities of the reduced, oxidized and transition states, and the activation overpotential is defined relative to the local Nernst potential. We also apply mathematical bounds on effective diffusivity to estimate porosity and tortuosity corrections. The theory is illustrated for a Li-ion battery with active solid particles described by a Cahn-Hilliard phase-field model. Depending on the applied current and porous electrode properties, the dynamics can be limited by electrolyte transport, solid diffusion and phase separation, or intercalation kinetics. In phase-separating porous electrodes, the model predicts narrow reaction fronts, mosaic instabilities and voltage fluctuations at low current, consistent with recent experiments, which could not be described by existing porous electrode models.},

abstract = {The traditional multicell battery design usually employs a fixed configuration to connect multiple cells in series and in parallel during operation in order to achieve the required voltage and current. However, this fixed configuration results in low reliability, low fault tolerance, and nonoptimal energy conversion efficiency. This paper proposes a novel power electronics-enabled self-X, multicell battery design. The proposed multicell battery can automatically configure itself according to the dynamic load/storage demand and the condition of each cell. The proposed battery can self-heal from failure or abnormal operation of single or multiple cells, self-balance from cell state variations, and self-optimize to achieve optimal energy conversion efficiency. These features are achieved by a new cell switching circuit and a high-performance battery management system proposed in this paper. The proposed design is validated by simulation and experiment for a 6 {\&}{\#}x00D7; 3 cell polymer lithium-ion battery.

A radial 1-D model is used to estimate the distribution using two inputs: the real or imaginary part of the electrochemical impedance of the cell at a single frequency, and the surface temperature. The approach does not require knowledge of cell thermal properties, heat generation or thermal boundary conditions. The model is validated experimentally, the first time for such an approach, using a cylindrical 26650 cell fitted with an internal thermocouple. The cell is heated by applying (1) current pulses of up to ??20 A and (2) a 3500 s HEV drive cycle current profile, whilst monitoring the surface and core temperatures and measuring impedance at 215 Hz. During the drive cycle test, the battery core temperature increases by 20 ??C and the surface temperature increases by 14??C. The mean absolute error in the predicted maximum temperature throughout the cycle is 0.6??C (3{\%} of the total core temperature increase), in contrast to a mean absolute error of 2.6??C if the temperature is assumed to be uniform (13{\%} of the total core temperature increase). ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The investigation involves detailed examination and comparison of harvested fresh and aged electrodes. The electrode properties are determined using a physics-based electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) model that is fitted to three-electrode EIS measurements, with input from measured electrode capacity and scanning electrode microscopy (SEM). Results from the model fitting provide a detailed insight to the electrode degradation and is put into context with the behavior of the full cell aging. It was established that calendar aging has negligible effect on cell impedance, while cycle aging increases the impedance mainly due to structural changes in the LiFePO4 porous electrode and electrolyte decomposition products on both electrodes. Further, full-cell capacity fade is mainly a consequence of cyclable lithium loss caused by electrolyte decomposition. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Only one control signal is needed for all MOSFETs, and energy can be directly transferred from higher voltage cells to lower voltage cells. A small capacitor is added to form a resonant circuit with the transformer magnetizing inductance so that soft switching can be achieved in some operation range to obtain high efficiency. The circuit balance function and soft-switching condition are analyzed and verified by simulation and experiments. A circuit for balancing a 4- and 12-cell battery group is tested. The experimental results showed the effectiveness of the circuit. The energy transfer efficiency between cells can reach up to 93{\%}. The circuit can be easily scaled to battery strings containing up to 12 battery cells, directly applicable to consumer electronics application where the number of cells is typically less than 12. A battery pack containing a large number of battery cells, such as the ones used in electric vehicles, can be balanced in groups, for example, in modules containing 12 cells each and with one additional circuit to balance among the modules.},

It is found that the hydrostatic stress has little effect on the distribution of stresses but the change of elastic modulus has a significant effect on the distribution of stresses. The hydrostatic stress has little effect on the location of maximum hoop stress in active layer. The change of elastic modulus can slow down the trend with closing to the inner surface for the location of the maximum hoop stress in active layer with the thicker current collector or larger modulus of current collector and speed up the trend with closing to the outer surface with the smaller ratio of electrode radius to thickness. The current collector should be as thin and soft as possible when its premise strength is satisfied. The ratio of electrode radius to thickness should be preferably larger than 15.

We define two types of flexible loads: (i) deferrable loads that have a fixed power profile but can be deferred in time and (ii) shapeable loads that have flexible power profiles but fixed energy requests, such as Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs). The proposed method uses a hierarchical control scheme based on a model predictive control (MPC) formulation for minimizing the global system cost. The first stage computes a reachable reference that trades off deviation from the nominal voltage with the required generation control. The second stage uses a price-based objective to aggregate flexible loads and provide load shaping services, while satisfying system constraints and users' preferences at all times. It is shown that the proposed controller is recursively feasible under specific conditions, i.e. the flexible load demands are satisfied and bus voltages remain within the desired limits. Finally, the proposed scheme is illustrated on a 55 bus radial distribution network.},

However, for a large number of battery cells, a conventional equalizer has the difficulty of individual cell balancing and the implementation size problem as well as the cost. Moreover, it shows high voltage stress of electrical elements in the equalization converter due to the high voltage of battery pack. To improve these drawbacks, this paper proposes a modularized two-stage charge equalizer with cell selection switches. The proposed circuit employs the two-stage dc-dc converter to reduce the voltage stress of equalization converter. Contrary to conventional method, the proposed equalizer can achieve the individual cell balancing only through the cell selection switches. With the two-stage converter and the cell selection switches, the proposed equalizer leads to the great size reduction with lower cost which brings advancement of individual cell balancing in a large number of battery cells. In this paper, a prototype for 88 lithium-ion battery cells is optimally designed and implemented. Experimental results are presented to verify that the proposed equalization method has a good cell balancing performance showing the low voltage stress and small size with the lower cost.},

This review outlines three fundamental materials challenges associated with large volume change, and then shows how nanostructured materials design can successfully address these challenges. There have been three generations of nanostructure design, encompassing solid nanostructures such as nanowires, hollow nanostructures, and clamped hollow structures.

abstract = {The Solid-Electrolyte-Interphase (SEI) model for non-aqueous alkali-metal batteries constitutes a paradigm change in the under-standing of lithium batteries and has thus enabled the development of safer, durable, higher-power and lower-cost lithium batteries for portable and EV applications. Prior to the publication of the SEI model (1979), researchers used the Butler-Volmer equation, in which a direct electron transfer from the electrode to lithium cations in the solution is assumed. The SEI model proved that this is a mistaken concept and that, in practice, the transfer of electrons from the electrode to the solution in a lithium battery, must be prevented, since it will result in fast self-discharge of the active materials and poor battery performance. This model provides [E. Peled, in " Lithium Batteries, " J.P. Gabano (ed), Academic Press, (1983), E. Peled, J. Electrochem. Soc., 126, 2047 (1979).] new equations for: electrode kinetics (i o and b), anode corrosion, SEI resistivity and growth rate and irreversible capacity loss of lithium-ion batteries. This model became a cornerstone in the science and technology of lithium batteries. This paper reviews the past, present and the future of SEI batteries. The Past Prior to the publication of the SEI model (1979), 1,4 researchers used the Butler-Volmer equation, in which direct electron transfer from the electrode to lithium cations in the solution is assumed. It was generally assumed that the rate-determining step (RDS) is the transfer of electrons from the metal to the cations in the solution. Researchers found that the lithium anode is covered by a passivating layer which interferes with the deposition/dissolution process of the anode. Brummer and Newman 2,3 concluded that a passivating anode can offer only a limited cycle life and in order to obtain a deep-discharge high-cycle-life secondary battery, the lithium anode must be free of a passivating layer and kinetically stable with respect to the electrolyte. The SEI model proved that this is a mistaken concept and that, in practice, the transfer of electrons from the electrode to the solution in a lithium battery, except when forming a SEI, must be prevented. The Present, Lithium-Metal and Lithium-Ion Batteries Introduction.—It is now generally accepted that the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) is essentially for the existence and suc-cessful operation of lithium-and sodium-battery systems, as primary and secondary power sources. 4 In 1979, it was proposed by Peled,},

abstract = {The intercalation pathway of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) in the positive electrode of a lithium-ion battery was probed at the ∼40 nm length scale using oxidation-state-sensitive X-ray microscopy. Combined with morphological observations of the same exact locations using transmission electron microscopy, we quantified the local state-of-charge of approximately 450 individual LFP particles over nearly the entire thickness of the porous electrode. With the electrode charged to 50{\%} state-of-charge in 0.5 h, we observed that the overwhelming majority of particles were either almost completely delithiated or lithiated. Specifically, only ∼2{\%} of individual particles were at an intermediate state-of-charge. From this small fraction of particles that were actively undergoing delithiation, we conclude that the time needed to charge a particle is ∼1/50 the time needed to charge the entire particle ensemble. Surprisingly, we observed a very weak correlation between the sequence of delithiation and the particle size, contrary to the common expectation that smaller particles delithiate before larger ones. Our quantitative results unambiguously confirm the mosaic (particle-by-particle) pathway of intercalation and suggest that the rate-limiting process of charging is initiating the phase transformation by, for example, a nucleation-like event. Therefore, strategies for further enhancing the performance of LFP electrodes should not focus on increasing the phase-boundary velocity but on the rate of phase-transformation initiation.},

abstract = {This paper provides a theoretical framework for analysis of consensus algorithms for multi-agent networked systems with an emphasis on the role of directed information flow, robustness to changes in network topology due to link/node failures, time-delays, and performance guarantees. An overview of basic concepts of information consensus in networks and methods of convergence and performance analysis for the algorithms are provided. Our analysis framework is based on tools from matrix theory, algebraic graph theory, and control theory. We discuss the connections between consensus problems in networked dynamic systems and diverse applications including synchronization of coupled oscillators, flocking, formation control, fast consensus in small-world networks, Markov processes and gossip-based algorithms, load balancing in networks, rendezvous in space, distributed sensor fusion in sensor networks, and belief propagation. We establish direct connections between spectral and structural properties of complex networks and the speed of information diffusion of consensus algorithms. A brief introduction is provided on networked systems with nonlocal information flow that are considerably faster than distributed systems with lattice-type nearest neighbor interactions. Simulation results are presented that demonstrate the role of small-world effects on the speed of consensus algorithms and cooperative control of multivehicle formations},

abstract = {When identical dry Li-ion batteries are filled with different electrolyte solutions, those with higher coulombic efficiency (CE) normally have a longer life-time, provided the batteries have the same test history (storage time and temperature, cycling protocol etc.). Accurate CE measurements can therefore be used to rapidly rank cells according to their life-time without relying on tests that are many years long. The CE of Li-ion cells normally increases with time since SEI layers thicken and parasitic reactions between electrodes and electrolyte, which cause the departure of the CE from unity, slow down. However, in some cases, the CE of Li-ion cells has been observed to be greater than unity and decrease during early charge-discharge cycling, which is unexpected. This anomalous behavior is shown here to be caused by the impact of lithium atoms stored in the negative electrode "overhang", the small portion of the negative electrode that extends past the positive electrode in commercial Li-ion cells. Storage protocols are discussed that allow CE to more rapidly stabilize with time or cycle number.},

In this study we identify three non-dimensional parameters which govern the stress response within a spherical storage particle, and we carry out numerical simulations to characterize the stresses that are developed. The non-dimensional parameters are developed using system properties such as the diffusion coefficient, particle radius, lithium partial molar volume and Young's modulus. Stress maps are generated for various values of these parameters for fixed rates of insertion, with boundary conditions applied to particles similar to those found in a battery. Stress and lithium concentration profiles for various values of these parameters show that the coupling between stress and concentration is magnified depending on the values of the parameters. The resulting maps can be used for different materials, depending on the value of the dimensionless parameters. Finally, the value of maximum stress generated is calculated for extraction of lithium from the particle and compared with those generated during insertion. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper presents a reduced switching-frequency active-harmonic-elimination method (RAHEM) to eliminate any number of specific order harmonics of multilevel converters. First, resultant theory is applied to transcendental equations to eliminate low-order harmonics and to determine switching angles for a fundamental frequency-switching scheme. Next, based on the number of harmonics to be eliminated, Newton climbing method is applied to transcendental equations to eliminate high-order harmonics and to determine switching angles for the fundamental frequency-switching scheme. Third, the magnitudes and phases of the residual lower order harmonics are computed, generated, and subtracted from the original voltage waveform to eliminate these low-order harmonics. Compared to the active-harmonic-elimination method (AHEM), which generates square waves to cancel high-order harmonics, RAHEM has lower switching frequency. The simulation results show that the method can effectively eliminate all the specific harmonics, and a low total harmonic distortion (THD) near sine wave is produced. An experimental 11-level H-bridge multilevel converter with a field-programmable gate-array controller is employed to experimentally validate the method. The experimental results show that RAHEM does effectively eliminate any number of specific harmonics, and the output voltage waveform has low switching frequency and low THD.},

All three user classes are children of a parent class (frac-lti) which contains some common attributes of fractional systems. Among enhancements of the object programming of the CRONE toolbox, is the overloading of basic operators (+,-,×, /, .×, ...) and standard Matlab scripts (lsim, bode, nichols, ...) for the new classes. As a consequence, an end user familiar with standard Matlab operators and scripts can use straightforwardly the CRONE toolbox.

In this paper, a new battery thermal management method using a reciprocating air flow for cylindrical Li-ion (LiMn 2O4/C) cells was numerically analyzed using (i) a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and (ii) a lumped-capacitance thermal model for battery cells and a flow network model. The battery heat generation was approximated by uniform volumetric joule and reversible (entropic) losses. The results of the CFD model were validated with the experimental results of in-line tube-bank systems which approximates the battery cell arrangement considered for this study. The numerical results showed that the reciprocating flow can reduce the cell temperature difference of the battery system by about 4 ??C (72{\%} reduction) and the maximum cell temperature by 1.5 ??C for a reciprocation period of ?? = 120 s as compared with the uni-directional flow case (?? = ???).

Impedance measurements on lithium-ion batteries between 1 Hz and 2 kHz give information about the electrochemical reactions within a cell, which relates to the state of charge (SOC), internal temperature, and state of health (SOH). We concentrate on the development of a measurement system for impedance that, for the first time, uses an excitation current generated by a motor controller. Using simple electronics to amplify and filter the voltage and current, we demonstrate accurate impedance measurements obtained with both multisine and noise excitation signals, achieving RMS magnitude measurement uncertainties between 1.9{\%} and 5.8{\%}, in comparison to a high-accuracy laboratory impedance analyzer. Achieving this requires calibration of the measurement circuits, including measurement of the inductance of the current sense resistor. A statistical correlation approach is used to extract the impedance information from the measured voltage and current signals in the presence of noise, allowing a wide range of excitation signals to be used. Finally, we also discuss the implementation challenges of an SOC estimation system based on impedance.},

A technique to fabricate polyimide embedded TFTC sensors on glass substrates and later transfer it onto thin copper foils is presented. The sensor transfer process can be easily integrated into the assembly process of a pouch cell, thus holding promise in implementing in Battery Management Systems (BMS). Internal temperature of the LIB pouch cell was measured in-situ when the sensor embedded battery was operated at high rate charge-discharge cycles. The polyimide embedded TFTCs survived the battery assembly process and the battery electrolyte environment. It is observed that the heat generation inside the battery is dominant during the high-rate of discharges. The developed technique can serve to improve the battery safety and performance when implemented in battery management systems and enhance the understanding of heat generation and its effects. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A passivation layer called the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is formed on electrode surfaces from decomposition products of electrolytes. The SEI allows Li + transport and blocks electrons in order to prevent further electrolyte decomposition and ensure continued electrochemical reactions. The formation and growth mechanism of the nanometer thick SEI films are yet to be completely understood owing to their complex structure and lack of reliable in situ experimental techniques. Significant advances in computational methods have made it possible to predictively model the fundamentals of SEI. This review aims to give an overview of state-of-the-art modeling progress in the investigation of SEI films on the anodes, ranging from electronic structure calculations to mesoscale modeling, covering the thermodynamics and kinetics of electrolyte reduction reactions, SEI formation, modification through electrolyte design, correlation of SEI properties with battery performance, and the artificial SEI design. Multi-scale simulations have been summarized and compared with each other as well as with experiments. Computational details of the fundamental properties of SEI, such as electron tunneling, Li-ion transport, chemical/mechanical stability of the bulk SEI and electrode/(SEI/) electrolyte interfaces have been discussed. This review shows the potential of computational approaches in the deconvolution of SEI properties and design of artificial SEI. We believe that computational modeling can be integrated with experiments to complement each other and lead to a better understanding of the complex SEI for the development of a highly efficient battery in the future.},

abstract = {To improve the use of lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicle (EV) applications, evaluations and comparisons of different equivalent circuit models are presented in this paper. Based on an analysis of the traditional lithium-ion battery equivalent circuit models such as the Rint, RC, Thevenin and PNGV models, an improved Thevenin model, named dual polarization (DP) model, is put forward by adding an extra RC to simulate the electrochemical polarization and concentration polarization separately. The model parameters are identified with a genetic algorithm, which is used to find the optimal time constant of the model, and the experimental data from a Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) test on a LiMn2O4 battery module. Evaluations on the five models are carried out from the point of view of the dynamic performance and the state of charge (SoC) estimation. The dynamic performances of the five models are obtained by conducting the Dynamic Stress Test (DST) and the accuracy of SoC estimation with the Robust Extended Kalman Filter (REKF) approach is determined by performing a Federal Urban Driving Schedules (FUDS) experiment. By comparison, the DP model has the best dynamic performance and provides the most accurate SoC estimation. Finally, sensitivity of the different SoC initial values is investigated based on the accuracy of SoC estimation with the REKF approach based on the DP model. It is clear that the errors resulting from the SoC initial value are significantly reduced and the true SoC is convergent within an acceptable error.},

abstract = {Coupled mechanical-chemical degradation of electrodes upon charging and discharging has been recognized as a major failure mechanism in lithium ion batteries. The instability of commonly employed electrolytes results in solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation. Although the SEI layer is necessary, as it passivates the electrode-electrolyte interface from further solvent decomposition, SEI formation consumes lithium and thus contributes to irreversible capacity loss. In this paper, we study irreversible capacity loss in a graphite-LiFePO4 cell. Our results support the mechanism of irreversible capacity loss due to the consumption of lithium in forming SEI. We attribute irreversible capacity loss to diffusion induced stresses (DISs) that cause pre-existing cracks on the electrode surfaces to grow gradually upon cycling, leading to the growth of SEI on the newly exposed electrode surfaces. Because lithium is consumed in forming the new SEI, irreversible capacity loss continues with cycling. Along with the SEI formation upon newly exposed (cracked) surfaces, the existing SEI thickness also grows with cycling, resulting in additional loss of lithium. In this study, we provide, a simple mathematical model, based on the Paris' Law formulation of mechanical fatigue, in combination with chemical degradation to explain battery life. We compare the predicted capacity at different temperatures with the experimental data obtained from electrochemical measurements on graphite-LiFePO4 cells.},

abstract = {Battery state of health (SOH) monitoring has become a crucial challenge in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and all electric vehicles (EVs) research, as SOH significantly affects the overall vehicle performance and life cycle. In this paper, we focus on the identification of Li-ion battery capacity fading, as the loss of capacity and therefore the driving range is a primary concern for EV and plug-in HEV (PHEV). While most studies on battery capacity fading are based on laboratory measurement such as open circuit voltage (OCV) curve, few publications have focused on capacity loss monitoring during on-board operations. We propose a battery SOH monitoring scheme based on partially charging data. Through analysis of battery aging cycle data, a robust signature associated with battery aging is identified through incremental capacity analysis (ICA). Several algorithms to extract this signature are developed and evaluated for on-board SOH monitoring. The use of support vector regression (SVR) is shown to provide the most consistent identification results with moderate computational load. For battery cells tested, we show that the SVR model built upon the data from one single cell is able to predict the capacity fading of 7 other cells within 1{\%} error bound. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.

The rate of SEI film growth depends on both solvent diffusion through the SEI film and solvent-reduction kinetics at the carbon surface. The model is able to simulate a wide variety of battery aging profiles, e.g., open-circuit and constant-voltage storage, charge/discharge cycling, etc. An analysis of capacity-fade data from the literature reveals that the same set of aging parameters may be used for predicting cycling and constant-voltage storage.

This is why, among the various means of maintaining a battery's peak performance, the importance of thermal management is emphasized. Since the early stages of the development of Li-ion batteries, much emphasis has been placed on battery cooling in order to secure stability, while less attention has been given to battery heating. However, in a low-temperature environment, using a battery without heating it severely undermines the battery's performance and life expectancy. A PHEV or an EV operates with energy that is stored by charging the battery, which can then be heated by an external source in a low? temperature environment prior to driving. In this study, a battery HILS and an environment simulation system are used to verify that pre-heating a battery in a low-temperature environment, using an external source, such as a charging stand, improves the battery's performance as compared to circumstances in which this is neglected.

In particular, the flow profiles of each individual battery cooling channel are calculated using the three-dimensional CFD sub-model. Using the predicted flow profiles of the cooling channel as flow boundary conditions the thermal behavior of battery cells is predicted using the one-dimensional battery pack network sub-model and the cell/module level thermal sub-model, in which both electrochemical reaction and double layer effect of battery cells are considered. The thermal behavior of battery cells is correlated through physical tests.

abstract = {In this report, cycling induced capacity fade of a LiFePO4 battery was studied and cycle-life models were established. Cell life data for establishing the model were collected using a large cycle-test matrix. The test matrix included three parameters, temperature (-30 to 60 ??C), depth of discharge (DOD) (90-10{\%}), and discharge rate (C-rate, ranging from C/2 to 10C, with the 1C rate corresponding to 2A). At the low C-rates, experimental results indicated that the capacity loss was strongly affected by time and temperature, while the DOD effect was less important. At the high C-rates, the charge/discharge rate effects became significant. To establish a life model, we adopt a power law equation in which the capacity loss followed a power law relation with time or charge throughput while an Arrhenius correlation accounted for the temperature effect. This model, when parameters were allowed to change with C-rates, was found to represent a large array of life cycle data. Finally, we discuss our attempts in establishing a generalized battery life model that accounts for Ah throughput (time), C-rate, and temperature. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The maximum resistance of the electrolyte and the surface layers on the sulfur and lithium electrodes was achieved in the region of the transition between the low? and high?voltage areas on the charge and discharge curves of the cells. This region corresponded to the highest concentration of lithium polysulfides in the electrolyte. For nearly charged or discharged lithium–sulfur cells, the impedance spectra contained linear segments which could be attributed to diffusion limitations at low frequencies.

Scheduling of even a single taskgraph while minimizing the weighted sum of a cost function has been shown to be NP-hard (Lawler, 1978). The presented methodology divides the problem in to two steps. First, a good DVS algorithm dynamically determines the minimum frequency of execution. Then, a greedy algorithm allows a near optimal priority function (Gruian, 2002) to choose the task which would maximize slack recovery. The methodology also ensures adherence of real time deadlines independent of the choice of the DVS algorithm and priority function used, while following battery guidelines to maximize battery lifetime. Battery simulations carried out on the profile generated by our methodology for a large set of taskgraphs show that battery life time is extended up to 23.3{\%} as compared to existing dynamic scheduling schemes},

Experimental results show that the high frequency arc is likely an experimental artifact caused by neglecting the frequency dependence of the shunt resistor.

Capacitor voltage balancing is a vital issue for proper operation of the MMC. Generally, conventional sensor- based balancing techniques require a significant amount of measurements, 2m(N-1) voltage sensors and 2m current sensors are required for a N-level m-phase converter. In this paper, a sensorless voltage balancing technique (self-balancing) is proposed for the MMC. The proposed technique eliminates all measurement boards used for monitoring capacitor voltages and arm currents, which in turn reduces system complexity and cost. Simulation and experimental results support and validate the proposed concept.},

conducted for the purpose of evaluating the battery thermal performance,
assessing the impact of air conditioning on fuel economy and emissions,
and providing information for NREL's Advanced Vehicle Simulator

performance of the battery packs used in these two vehicles during
chassis dynamometer testing is presented. Specially designed charge and
discharge chassis dynamometer test cycles revealed that the Insight
limited battery usage to 60{\%} of rated capacity, while the Prius limited
battery usage to 40{\%} of the rated capacity. The Prius uses substantially
more pack energy over a given driving cycle but at the same time
maintains the pack within a tight target state of charge (SOC) of 54{\%} to
56{\%}. The Insight does not appear to force the battery to a specific
target SOC. The Prius battery contributes a higher percentage of the
power needed for propulsion. The study also found that while both
vehicles have adequate battery thermal management system for mild
driving conditions, the Prius thermal management is more robust, and the
Insight thermal management limits pack performance in certain conditions

abstract = {This paper presents a complete method that is used to balance dc link voltages in a cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) multilevel rectifier. Recently, such converters have been the subject of extensive research due to their suitability for high-power applications. One requirement in using a multilevel active rectifier at high levels of power is to limit the switching losses by reducing the switching frequency to a minimum. Another requirement for these converters is to ensure that individual dc link capacitor voltages for each cell of the converter are always balanced to ensure controllability and to limit stress on the converter cells. This paper presents a complete method in solving both of these problems using a selective-harmonic-elimination pulsewidth-modulation scheme. The scheme utilizes a simple controller to track each cell dc link capacitor voltage magnitude and accordingly biases the power flowing into each cell to ensure that the voltages across each cell capacitor converge. This is the case even when the loads attached to the individual cells are not balanced. The theory is supported by both simulated results from Saber and by experimental results from a seven-level CHB single-phase multilevel rectifier.},

The method relies on linearizing the standard porous-electrode equations around a fixed state-of-charge (SOC) and operating temperature setpoint. The ROM is able to track a highly dynamic input accurately near the linearization setpoint, but its performance degrades as either the cell's SOC or temperature move away from this linearization point. This paper describes a way to extend the accuracy of the ROM over a wide range of SOCs and temperatures using a model-blending approach. Our results demonstrate that the approach accurately models the cell's voltage and internal electrochemical variables over a wide range of temperature and SOC, with little added computational complexity. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The design and experimental verification of a 50 kHz prototype system is presented, and quantitative performance comparisons are made between synchronized clocking, independent clocking, and interleaved clocking of the converter cells. The experimental results corroborate the analytical predictions and demonstrate the tremendous benefits of the distributed interleaving approach},

- When the converters are interleaved, the average value on the bus is zero.

Opposing that fact the disparity of cells due to production process and different boundary conditions is mostly neglected in system design. The cells are rather considered as even according to parameterisation measurements carried out and lifetime experiments of only a few cells per test condition. This study will show that the diversification of the cells has to be taken into account during system layout and packaging in order to optimise the lifetime and performance on system level. Moreover, the impact of the operation strategy on ageing is analysed more in detail and guidelines are given.

abstract = {Lithium is a highly interesting metal, in part due to the increasing interest in lithium-ion batteries. Several recent studies have used different methods to estimate whether the lithium production can meet an increasing demand, especially from the transport sector, where lithium-ion batteries are the most likely technology for electric cars. The reserve and resource estimates of lithium vary greatly between different studies and the question whether the annual production rates of lithium can meet a growing demand is seldom adequately explained. This study presents a review and compilation of recent estimates of quantities of lithium available for exploitation and discusses the uncertainty and differences between these estimates. Also, mathematical curve fitting models are used to estimate possible future annual production rates. This estimation of possible production rates are compared to a potential increased demand of lithium if the International Energy Agency's Blue Map Scenarios are fulfilled regarding electrification of the car fleet. We find that the availability of lithium could in fact be a problem for fulfilling this scenario if lithium-ion batteries are to be used. This indicates that other battery technologies might have to be implemented for enabling an electrification of road transports. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The detailed isothermal electrochemical model for a lithium ion cell has ten coupled partial differential equations to describe the cell behavior. In an earlier publication [Journal of Power Sources, 222, 426 (2013)], a reduced order model (ROM) was developed by reducing the detailed model to a set of five linear ordinary differential equations and nonlinear algebraic expressions, using uniform reaction rate, volume averaging and profile based approximations. An arbitrary current profile, involving charge, rest and discharge, is broken down into constant current and linearly varying current periods. The linearly varying current period results are generic, since it includes the constant current period results as well. Hence, the linear ordinary differential equations in ROM are solved for a linearly varying current period and an explicit algebraic algorithm is developed for lithium ion cell voltage prediction. While the existing battery management system (BMS) algorithms are equivalent circuit based and ordinary differential equations, the proposed algorithm is an explicit algebraic algorithm. These results are useful to develop a BMS algorithm for on-board applications in electric or hybrid vehicles, smart phones etc. This algorithm is simple enough for a spread-sheet implementation and is useful for rapid analysis of laboratory data. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Abstract: Most Li ion insertion batteries consist of a porous cathode, a separator filled with electrolyte and an anode, which very often also has some porous structure. The solid part especially in the cathode is usually produced by mixing a powder of the actual active particles, in which Li ions will be intercalated, binder and carbon black to enhance the electronic conductivity of the electrode. As a result the porous structure of the electrodes is very complex, leading to complex potential, ion and temperature distributions within the electrodes. The intercalation and deintercalation of ions cannot be expected to be homogeneously distributed over the electrode due to the different transport properties of electrolyte and active particles in the electrode and the complex three-dimensional pore structure of the electrode. The influence of the final microstructure on the distribution of temperature, electric potential and ions within the electrodes is not known in detail, but may influence strongly the onset of degradation mechanisms. For being able to numerically simulate the transport phenomena, the equations and interface conditions for ion, charge and heat transport within the complex structure of the electrodes and through the electrolyte filled separator are needed. We will present a rigorous derivation of these equations based exclusively on general principles of nonequilibrium thermodynamics. The theory is thermodynamically consistent i.e. it guarantees strictly positive entropy production. The irreversible and reversible sources of heat are derived within the theory. Especially the various contribution to the Peltier heat due to the intercalation of ions are obtained as a result of the theory.

abstract = {The recently increase of the EV/PHEV market is in part due to the technological progress of battery systems. The energy storage and charging are the critical aspects of an electric vehicle; Li-Ion batteries allow an increase in storage performance and efficiencies despite the needs of a high number of cells. The single Li-Ion cell is constituted by metals, graphite, various salts and electrolytes which result difficult to dispose of or recycle. Therefore the expected environmental sustainability of any EV is limited by the final impact of battery production and disposal. The proposed research studies the Second Life applications suitable for the Li-Ion battery cells used for electric powertrains in order to promote a Sustainable Transportation and avoid the environmental impact that disposal of these batteries would have. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis has been adopted to estimate the gain in terms of environmental impact provided by reusing disposed Li-Ion cells for a Second Life application. An automotive battery pack with LiFePO4 cells has been chosen as a test case, then the life-cycle due to vehicle loads has been predicted by accelerated tests and the residual cell capacity has been experimentally evaluated. A possible Second Life scenario has been studied for the automotive Li-Ion batteries: reusing the disposed cell in a smart grid system after vehicle use to provide the grid energy stabilization and storage. This strategy has been evaluated with an LCA tool taking into account materials (anode, cathode, separator, et.), as well as flows and processes (production, assembly, disassembly) both for production and reuse phases. The research results show a positive effect of the Second Life solution on the environmental impact of the Li-Ion cells; moreover, the collected data will be useful for the Second Life strategies and scheduling during the early design phase.},

abstract = {With large scale battery systems being more and more used in demanding applications regarding lifetime, performance and safety, it is of great importance to utilize not only cells with a high cyclic and calendric lifetime but also to optimize the whole system architecture. The aim of this work is therefore, to highlight the benefits of a modular system architecture allowing the use of hybrid battery systems combining high power and high energy cells in a multi-technology system. To achieve an optimized performance, efficiency and lifetime for an electric vehicle the complete drive train topology has to be taken into account instead of optimizing one of the components individually. Consequently, the topic will be analyzed from the system's point of view, addressing in particular the modularization of the battery as well as the power electronics needed to do so. It will be shown that a highly flexible battery system can be realized by dc-to-dc converters between a modular, hybrid battery system and the drive inverter. By the dc-to-dc converters the battery output voltages and the inverter input voltages are decoupled. Hence, the battery's topology can be chosen unrestrictedly within a wide range and easily be interconnected to a common dc-link of a different voltage. The benefits of this flexibility will be analyzed in detail showing especially how the lifetime of the battery system can be improved and the impact on system weight. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Identifiability is addressed both in principle and in practice. The approach begins by grouping parameters and partially non-dimensionalising the SPM in order to understand the maximum expected degrees of freedom in the problem. We discover that, excluding open circuit voltage, there are only six unique parameters in the model. We then examine the structural identifiability by asking whether the transfer function of the linearised SPM is unique. It is found that the model is unique provided that the electrode open circuit voltage functions have a known and non-zero gradient, the parameters are ordered, and that the behaviour of the kinetics of each electrode is lumped together into a single parameter which is the charge transfer resistance. We then run simulations to demonstrate the practical estimation of parameters from noisy data.},

We show that SMC not only facilitates lithium diffusion, but also significantly relieves the maximum stress and its corresponding peak value during lithium insertion, and therefore, declines the probability of fracture in the electrode particle. Moreover, the effect of SMC is found to be more obvious for higher surface current density or lower stress coupling due to the significant concentration gradient of lithium. Finally, by investigating the combined effect of current density and stress, this work provides insights on the presence of SMC, as well as suggestions for the relevant modeling works on whether the SMC should be taken into account for material selection and designing.},

abstract = {Multilevel voltage source converters are emerging as a new breed
of power converter options for high-power applications. The multilevel
voltage source converters typically synthesize the staircase voltage
wave from several levels of DC capacitor voltages. One of the major
limitations of the multilevel converters is the voltage unbalance
between different levels. The techniques to balance the voltage between
different levels normally involve voltage clamping or capacitor charge
control. There are several ways of implementing voltage balance in
multilevel converters. Without considering the traditional magnetic
coupled converters, this paper presents three multilevel voltage source
converters: (1) diode-clamp, (2) flying-capacitors, and (3)
cascaded-inverters with separate DC sources. The operating principle,
features, constraints, and potential applications of these converters
are discussed},

abstract = {Lithium ion (Li-ion) batteries provide high energy and power density energy storage for diverse applications ranging from cell phones to hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs). For efficient and reliable systems integration, low order dynamic battery models are needed. This paper introduces a general method to generate numerically a fully observable/controllable state variable model from electrochemical kinetic, species and charge partial differential equations that govern the discharge/charge behavior of a Li-ion battery. Validated against a 313th order nonlinear CFD model of a 6 Ah HEV cell, a 12th order state variable model predicts terminal voltage to within 1{\%} for pulse and constant current profiles at rates up to 50 C. The state equation is constructed in modal form with constant negative real eigenvalues distributed in frequency space from 0 to 10 Hz. Open circuit potential, electrode surface concentration/reaction distribution coupling and electrolyte concentration/ionic conductivity nonlinearities are explicitly approximated in the model output equation on a local, electrode-averaged and distributed basis, respectively. The balanced realization controllability/observability gramian indicates that the fast electrode surface concentration dynamics are more observable/controllable than the electrode bulk concentration dynamics (i.e. state of charge). ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Experimental thermal property data of the Sony US-18650 lithium-ion battery and components are presented, as well as thermal property measuring techniques. The properties in question are specific heat capacity (Cp), thermal diffusivity (a), and thermal conductivity (k), in the presence and absence of electrolyte [1 M LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate-dimethyl carbonate (EC:DMC, 1:1 wt {\%})]: The heat capacity of the battery, Cp, is 0.96 6 0.02 J g21 K21 at an open-circuit voltage (OCV) of 2.75 V, and 1.04 6 0.02 J g21 K21 at 3.75 V. The thermal conductivity, k, was calculated from k ; arCp where a was measured by a xenon-flash technique. In the absence of electrolyte, k increases with OCV, for both the negative electrode (NE) and the positive electrode (PE). For the NE, the increase is 26{\%} as the OCV increases from 2.75 to 3.75 V, whereas for the PE the increase is only 5 to 6{\%}. The dependence of both Cp and k on OCV is explained qualitatively by considering the effect of lithiation and delithiation on the electron carrier density, which leads to n-type semiconduction in the graphitic NE material, but a change from semiconducting to metallic character in LixCoO2 PE material. The overall effect is an increase of Cp and k with OCV. For k this dependence is eliminated by electrolyte addition, which, however, greatly increases the effective k of the layered battery components by lowering the thermal contact resistance. For both NE and PE, the in-plane k value (measured along layers) is nearly one order of magnitude higher than the cross-plane k. This is ascribed mostly to the high thermal conductivity of the current collectors and to a lesser extent to the orientation of particles in the layers of electrodes.},

It not only inherits the advantage of conventional switched-capacitor battery cell balancing system, but also overcomes the drawback of conduction loss, switching loss, and finite voltage difference among battery cells. All switches are MOSFET and controlled by just a pair of complementary signals in synchronous trigger pattern and the resonant tanks operate alternatively between the two states of charging and discharging. Zero-current switching and zero-voltage gap are achieved in this paper. Different resonant tank designs can meet the needs of different balancing time to meet the needs of different energy storage devices.

The poor performance of these batteries in cold climates is of major concern because they suffer a huge loss in capacity. Another symptom of this low performance is a dramatic increase in the series resistance of the battery, RB, as the temperature drops. Experiments were performed with both low and high frequency heaters, and several tests were conducted on both lead acid and nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries at different AC amplitudes, states of charge (SOCs) and cold temperatures. Low frequency 60 Hz heating was first tested on several different 38 Ah lead acid batteries. The feasibility of using high frequency heating was then tested using a 10-20 kHz inverter on a pack of 6.5 Ah nickel metal hydride (NiMH) batteries. A technique also was developed to estimate the internal battery temperature, Tbat, by measuring the battery source resistance, RB. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The reason for current density inhomogeneities is found to be the local electrochemical impedance varying with temperature in different regions of the jelly roll. For the investigated cell, high power cycling and the resulting temperature gradient additionally cause SoC-gradients inside the jelly roll. The local SoCs inside one cell diverge firstly because of asymmetric current density distributions during charge and discharge inside the cell and secondly because of the temperature dependence of the local open circuit potential. Even after long relaxation periods, the SoC distribution in cycled LiFePO
4-cells remains inhomogeneous across the jelly roll as a result of hysteresis in the open circuit voltage. The occurring thermal electrical inhomogeneities are expected to influence local aging differences and thus, global cell aging.

abstract = {When assembling lithium-ion cells into functional battery packs, it is common to connect multiple cells in parallel. Here we present experimental and modeling results demonstrating that, when lithium ion cells are connected in parallel and cycled at high rate, matching of internal resistance is important in ensuring long cycle life of the battery pack. Specifically, a 20{\%} difference in cell internal resistance between two cells cycled in parallel can lead to approximately 40{\%} reduction in cycle life when compared to two cells parallel-connected with very similar internal resistance. We show that an internal resistance mismatch leads to high current into each cell during part of the charging cycle. Since capacity fading is strongly dependent on temperature, and hence on charging rate when this rate is sufficiently high, the high current leads to substantially accelerated capacity fade in both cells. A model, based on the formation of a solid-electrolyte interphase, is able to explain the dependence of lifetime on resistance mismatch, and also identifies the importance of random sudden capacity losses. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are promising technologies to help reduce the amount of petroleum consumed for transportation. In both HEVs and PHEVs, the battery pack is a key component to enabling their fuel savings potential. The battery is also one of the most expensive components in the vehicle. One of the most significant factors impacting both the performance and life of a battery is temperature. In particular, operating a battery at elevated temperatures reduces its life. It is therefore important to design and implement effective battery thermal management systems. This paper analyzes the suitability of phase-change material (PCM) for battery thermal management in HEV and PHEV systems. A prototype PCM/ graphite matrix module (that was not fully optimized for HEV applications) was evaluated experimentally under geometric and vehicle-simulation-based drive cycles. The results were used to validate a thermal model. The model was then used to explore the benefits and limitations of PCM thermal management. This study suggests that PCM can provide a peak-temperature-limiting benefit in vehicle applications, but the overall battery thermal management solution must rely on active cooling or on limiting the battery's power output (or both) to avoid high temperatures during continuous cycling. Ultimately, vehicle designers will need to weigh the potential increase in mass and cost associated with adding PCM to the thermal management system against the anticipated benefits: a smaller active cooling system, less need to limit battery power output in high-temperature conditions, and/or potentially reduced exposure to momentary or localized high cell temperatures.},

abstract = {As the personal computer makers push for DC-DC converters delivering 200 Amps at 1 V within the next three years, the semiconductor manufacturers are pushing to optimize their MOSFET by improving both the silicon and the packages to provide switching devices suitable for these challenges. In this paper we address the parasitic resistance attributed to the package alone and in isolation from the silicon on-resistance. We show that in most of the traditional packages this resistance has a very strong frequency dependant component. This means that at a switching frequency of about a few megahertz, this parasitic resistance will constitute a large percentage of the total device on-resistance. Based on this observation, we concentrate on the synchronous buck converter and we derive conduction loss equations that are frequency dependent and calculate actual losses and examine several effects that follow},

partially observed discrete-event systems. The authors' (1988) previous
results on decentralized supervision and supervision under partial

and conditions for the existence of a coordinating supervisor are
established. It is concluded that decentralized supervision will be
easier to design and implement that centralized supervision; under
suitable conditions it will be equivalent with respect to overall
closed-loop system behavior. In achieving this equivalence a key role is
played by the linguistic property of normality. As shown by an
illustrative example, the results have application to such complex

abstract = {The lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery of high power density and large electricity capacity is pioneering both uncultivated lands, the electric vehicle (EV) for driving longer distances, and the electricity storage system (ESS) for storing huger amount of electricity. Still, the high capital cost of Li-ion battery, around 50{\%} of an EV, currently impede the universal market adoptions of EV and ESS industries. Through a sophisticated repurposing process and a clever business operation, the used Liion batteries retired from EV usually holding residual 70 {\~{}} 80{\%} electricity-storage capacities can create long-term and stable profits from proper second-use or repurposing applications, such as the electricity-storage batteries of an ESS for storing the electricity from renewable energy systems. From the viewpoint of environment protection, this transforming movement firmly meets with the “eco-3R” principles of recycle, reuse and reduce. During the “pre-recycling” period of second-use application, more creative technologies to dispose of the large-sized and unable-to-reuse Li-ion batteries can be developed. A complete eco-life of an EV Li-ion battery can be achieved. In this research, the critical issues are explored, including challenges, repurposing processes, cost analyses, and optimal business models for transforming a used Li-ion battery pack retired from EV into ESS for its second-use application. The estimated profit rate of a case study can reach around 39{\%}; namely, a 10kWh Li-ion battery pack of 20-year calendar life primarily works in EV for 5 years, and then runs in ESS for following residual 15 years.},

Battery performance, irreversible charge "loss", rate capability, cyclability, exfoliation of graphite and safety are highly dependent on the quality of the SEI. Therefore, understanding the actual nature and composition of SEI is of prime interest. If the chemistry of the SEI formation and the manner in which each component affects battery performance are understood, SEI could be tuned to improve battery performance. In this paper key points related to the nature, formation, and features of the SEI formed on carbon negative electrodes are discussed. SEI has been analyzed by various analytical techniques amongst which FTIR and XPS are most widely used. FTIR and XPS data of SEI and its components as published by many research groups are compiled in tables for getting a global picture of what is known about the SEI.

abstract = {This paper discusses some important aspects of the correlation between surface chemistry, 3D structure, and the electrochemical behavior of lithiated graphite electrodes. By reviewing results obtained with different electrolyte solutions (e.g. ethylene carbonate-based solutions, propylene carbonate solutions, and ether-based systems), we describe the stabilization and capacity fading mechanisms of graphite electrodes. One of the failure mechanisms occurs at potentials {\textgreater} 0.5 V Li/Li+, and relates to an increase in the electrode's impedance due to improper passivation and a simultaneous change in the electrode's morphology, probably due to gas formation. At low potentials (depending on the electrolyte solution involved), phenomena such as exfoliation and amorphization of the graphite electrodes can be observed. Stabilization mechanisms are also discussed. In general, surface stabilization of the graphite is essential for obtaining reversible lithiation and a long electrode cycle life. The latter usually relates to precipitation of highly compact and insoluble surface species, which adhere well, and irreversibly, to the active surface. Hence, the choice of appropriate electrolyte solutions in terms of solvents, salts and additives is very critical for the use of graphite anodes in Li batteries. The major analytical tools for this study included FTIR and impedance spectroscopies, XPS, and in situ and ex situ XRD in conjunction with standard electrochemical techniques.},

Current source converters possess the advantage of short-circuit fault tolerance, which is a pivotal feature for grid applications. By partially following the circuit duality transformations, the proposed converter is derived from the well-known voltage source MMC. Inductor-based current source cells are connected in parallel and form a current source arm that can synthesize a desired current waveform. By adding a reduced-energy capacitor in parallel to each current source arm, these arms can be further connected in series, thereby allowing voltage scaling. By using fully controllable switches, the converter is capable of providing full control on its active and reactive power. Protection schemes against open-circuit failures inside the inductor cells are also proposed. Simulation results show the operation of the current source MMC and its capability of DC fault tolerance.},

The simulation is validated with measurements on a balancing prototype with ten cells. It is then shown how the active balancing method with respect to the cell voltages can be improved using the capacity and the state of charge rather than the voltage as the balancing criterion. For both charging and discharging, an improvement in performance is gained when having the state of charge and the capacity of the cells as information. A battery stack with three single cells is modeled, and a realistic driving cycle is applied to compare the difference between both methods in terms of usable energy.

abstract = {Because of the diversiform driving conditions and the cell variations, it is difficult to accurately determine battery pack capacities in electric vehicles (EVs) by model prediction or direct measurement. This paper studies the charging cell voltage curves (CCVC) for the estimation of the LiFePO 4 battery pack capacities in EVs. We propose the uniform CCVC hypothesis and estimate cell capacities by overlapping CCVCs using CCVC transformation. CCVCs of two LiFePO4 cells with large capacity difference are used to verify the hypothesis. We further develop an equivalent simplified approach using voltage-capacity rate curve (VCRC) and implement Genetic Algorithm (GA) to find the optimum transformation parameter for overlapping VCRCs. A small battery pack with four LiFePO4 cells in series is employed to verify the method and the result shows that the estimation errors of both pack capacity and cell capacities are less than 1{\%}. With the proposed method, the battery pack capacity can be precisely estimated which could be used for the driving range prediction. Meanwhile, the estimated cell capacities in battery packs will significantly support the study of cell degradation and cell variations in vehicle driving conditions. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Each phase leg of the MMC consists of two series connected strings of submodules, where each string of submodules is referred to as a phase arm. Based on analytically developed inter-arm power flow relations, a control methodology is proposed that provides fully independent control of each arm's real power flow, facilitating extreme levels of inter-arm power transfer. This eliminates the need for uniform integration of DER units across all submodules of the MMC. Among others, viable operating configurations are shown to include: DERs only integrated in upper (or lower) phase arms and DERs integrated only in the upper and lower phase arms of a single phase leg. Power balance is maintained internal to the MMC via dc and ac currents circulating within the converter without distorting input dc or output ac currents. To maximize conversion efficiency, a mechanism for minimizing the necessary circulating ac currents under any inter-arm power flow condition is also identified. Comprehensive simulation results validate both the developed model and controls.},

The complete procedure is demonstrated by the TIS-application on a cylindrical High-Power Li-Ion cell. By the use of a thermal battery model, its theoretical transfer function can be fitted to the TIS-measurement results in the Nyquist-Plot. Consequently, the specific heat capacity and the heat conductivity of the cell's jelly roll can be derived.

The results show that at stressful conditions, i.e. at high discharge rates and at high operating or ambient temperatures (for example 40-45 ??C), air-cooling is not a proper thermal management system to keep the temperature of the cell in the desirable operating range without expending significant fan power.

abstract = {Despite its inherently modular hardware structure, the control system of most cascaded H-bridge converters is usually highly centralized, and relies on a high bandwidth intra-converter communication system to transmit time critical control signals to the module controllers. In contrast, this paper presents a decentralized control strategy for a modular cascaded converter, where each module controller determines its own switching actions based on local sensors, a local current regulator and a local modulator. The system achieves the same performance as a centralized control system, with a low bandwidth requirement for the intra-converter communication system. Controller high voltage isolation requirements are also reduced because most of the system measurement sensors can be embedded within each converter module slave controller.},

According to the types and blending ratios of constituting active materials, there can be numerous combinations of blended-electrodes, resulting in different performance characteristics.

abstract = {The performance loss of lithium-ion batteries with lithium iron phosphate positive chemistry was analyzed using electrochemical characterization techniques such as galvanostatic charge–discharge at different rates, ac impedance, and hybrid pulse power characterization measurements. Differentiation analysis of the discharge profiles as well as in situ reference electrode measurement revealed loss of lithium as well as degradation of the carbon negative; the cell capacity, however, was limited by the amount of active lithium. Destructive physical analyses and ex situ electrochemical analyses were performed at test completion on selected cells. While no change in positive morphology and performance was detected, significant cracking and delamination of the carbon negative was observed. In addition, X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the changes in the crystal structure of the graphite during cycling. The degradation of the carbon negative is consistent with the observations from the electrochemical analysis. Ex situ electrochemical analysis confirmed that active lithium controlled cell capacity and its loss with cycling directly correlated with cell degradation. The relationship between carbon negative degradation and loss of active lithium is discussed in the context of a consistent overall mechanism.},

By introducing a parameter, called the swelling coefficient, the relative magnitudes of the change in electrode dimensions and the change in porosity are determined. The swelling coefficient is design-dependent and measured experimentally for a given cell design. The model is general and forms a critical addition required to extend the existing porous electrode models to include volume change effects.

The simulated thermal system was comprised of the vehicle cabin, seat cavity, inlet plenum, battery pack, a downstream centrifugal fan, and the vehicle trunk. The fan was modeled using a multiple reference frame approach. A full system analysis was done for airflow and thermal performance optimization to ensure the most uniform cell temperatures under all operating conditions. The mesh for the full system was about 13 million cells run on a 6-node HP cluster. A baseline design was first analyzed for fluid-thermal performance. Subsequently, multiple design iterations were run to create uniform airflow among all the individual bricks while minimizing parasitic pressure drop. NVH issues were also addressed in the design by keeping the flow streamlined thereby minimizing flow induced turbulence. The prediction for system pressure drop and cell temperature correlated well with test data on an instrumented battery pack.},

abstract = {Based on the fact that a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) connects a high number of batteries in series to obtain more than approximately 300 V, this paper proposes a modularized charge equalizer for an HEV battery pack. In this paper, the overall battery string is modularized into {\textless}i{\textgreater}M*N{\textless}/i{\textgreater}cells, where {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}/i{\textgreater}is the number of modules in the string and {\textless}i{\textgreater}N{\textless}/i{\textgreater}is the number of cells in each module. With this modularization, low voltage stress on the electronic devices can be achieved, which means that there is less chance of a failure on the charge equalizer. The power rating selection is one of the most important design issues for a charge equalizer because it is very closely related to equalization time. To solve this problem optimally, this paper presents a power rating design guide. In addition, this paper considers system-level design issues, such as cell voltage acquisition, equalizer control logic, and system-level grounding. The simulation and experimental results are presented to show the usefulness of the optimal power rating selection guide and the low voltage stressed charge equalization process.},

The model considers mass transport through the system, deformation and stress in the anode and cathode, electrostatic fields, as well as the electrochemical reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. It extends existing analyses by accounting for the effects of finite strains and plastic flow in the electrodes, and by exploring in detail the role of stress in the electrochemical reactions at the electrode-electrolyte interfaces. In particular, we find that that stress directly influences the rest potential at the interface, so that a term involving stress must be added to the Nernst equation if the stress in the solid is significant. The model is used to predict the variation of stress and electric potential in a model 1-D half-cell, consisting of a thin film of Si on a rigid substrate, a fluid electrolyte layer, and a solid Li cathode.

An adapted version of the simplified refined instrumental variable method is first proposed to estimate the parameters of the fractional model when all the differentiation orders are assumed known. Then, an optimization approach based on the use of the developed instrumental variable estimator is presented. Two variants of the algorithm are proposed. Either, all differentiation orders are set as integral multiples of a commensurate order which is estimated, or all differentiation orders are estimated. The former variant allows to reduce the number of parameters and can be used as a good initial hit for the latter variant. The performances of the proposed approaches are evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation analysis. Finally, the proposed identification algorithms are used to identify thermal diffusion in an experimental setup. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In battery packs with cells in parallel, the inter-cell connection resistances can cause unequal loads due to non-uniform interconnect overpotentials and consequentially lead to non-uniform heating. This article explores how load imbalances are generated in automotive applications, by describing a battery pack with finite interconnect resistances. Each cell inside the pack is represented by a pseudo 2D electrochemical model coupled with a lumped thermal model. Increasing the number of cells in parallel results in a linear increase in load non-uniformity, whilst increasing the ratio of interconnect to battery impedance results in a logarithmic increase in load non-uniformity, with cells closest to the load points experiencing the largest currents. Therefore, interconnect resistances of the order of m?? can have a significant detrimental impact. Under steady state discharge the cell impedance changes until the loads balance. This process, however, can take hundreds of seconds and therefore may never happen under dynamic load cycles. Cycling within a narrow state-of-charge range and pulse loading are shown to be the most detrimental situations. Upon load removal, re-balancing can occur causing further heating. Simulation of a 12P7S pack under a real world load cycle shows that these effects could cause localised thermal runaway. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Understanding the failure mechanism of silicon-based anode electrodes for lithium-ion batteries is essential to solve the problem of low coulombic efficiency and capacity fading on cycling and also to further commercialize this very new energetic material in cells. To reach this goal, the structure changes of bulk silicon particles and electrode after cycling were studied using ex-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The SEM images indicated that the microstructural changes of the bulk silicon particles during cycling led to a layer rupture of the electrode and then the breakdown of the conductive network and the failure of the electrode.

Postmortem analysis of the cells is performed after full-cell electrochemical characterization and discharge. EIS and capacity measurements are made on different parts of the disassembled cells. Material characterization includes SEM, EDX, HAXPES/XPS and XRD. The most remarkable result is that both cycled cells displayed highly uneven aging primarily of the graphite electrodes, showing large differences between the central parts of the jellyroll compared to the outer parts. The aging variations are identified as differences in capacity and impedance of the graphite electrode, associated with different SEI characteristics. Loss of cyclable lithium is mirrored by a varying degree of lithiation in the positive electrode and electrode slippage. The spatial variation in negative electrode degradation and utilization observed is most likely connected to gradients in temperature and pressure, that can give rise to current density and potential distributions within the jellyroll during cycling. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The short-circuit and overcharge behavior of prismatic lithium-ion batteries containing LiCoO2 cathodes and graphite anodes were studied in detail. Internal thermocouples were used to characterize the thermal profiles of the cells under abusive conditions. Differences between the internal and surface temperatures of the cells during the safety tests highlighted the importance of the internal measurement for obtaining more meaningful data. Under short-circuit conditions the cells remained hermetically sealed, reached an internal temperature of 132°C (the shutdown temperature of the separator), and then slowly cooled to ambient temperature. However, on extreme overcharge testing different results were obtained depending on the current used to charge the battery. At low currents ({\textless}=C/5) the cells remained hermetic, but swelled significantly. When higher currents were used, the cells ruptured during overcharge. Experimental cells were constructed with a systematic variation in cell balance and the point of cell rupture tracked to the amount of cathode in the cell, independent of the amount of anode material. The internal dc resistance of the cell was also measured during the overcharge reaction and remained low throughout most of the test, although a large increase was observed at the end of the test due to the melting of the shutdown separator. The cells overcharged with high currents all reached high temperatures ({\textgreater}=195°C) immediately prior to rupturing, which suggests that the melting of lithium is a key underlying factor leading to the rupture of the cells. To test this proposal, cells were assembled with lithium removed from the LiCoO2 cathode, so that lithium metal would not plate on the anode during the overcharge test. These cells reached a significantly higher temperature ({\~{}}280°C) prior to rupture. {\textcopyright}2001 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved. },

abstract = {Lithium-titanate batteries have become an attractive option for battery electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. In order to maintain safe operating temperatures, these batteries must be actively cooled during operation. Liquid-cooled systems typically employed for this purpose are inefficient due to the parasitic power consumed by the on-board chiller unit and the coolant pump. A more efficient option would be to circulate ambient air through the battery bank and directly reject the heat to the ambient. We designed and fabricated such an air-cooled thermal management system employing metal-foam based heat exchanger plates for sufficient heat removal capacity. Experiments were conducted with Altairnano's 50 Ah cells over a range of charge-discharge cycle currents at two air flow rates. It was found that an airflow of 1100 mls 
-1 per cell restricts the temperature rise of the coolant air to less than 10 ??C over ambient even for 200 A charge-discharge cycles. Furthermore, it was shown that the power required to drive the air through the heat exchanger was less than a conventional liquid-cooled thermal management system. The results indicate that air-cooled systems can be an effective and efficient method for the thermal management of automotive battery packs. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Abstract: The State-of-Charge (SOC) is an important performance parameter and evaluation index in rechargeable battery energy storage systems. Here, a novel smart estimation method based on coulomb counting is proposed in order to enhance estimation accuracy. Firstly, an enhanced model for the initial SOC (SOC0) estimation based on dynamic multi-parameter method is investigated, because SOC0 plays a key role in calculating real SOC in-time. All the design limits, such as voltage, temperature, are used as its constraints. And more importantly, the relaxation effect also is considered. The SOC0 with the main parameters satisfies Gauss function. Secondly, the quantitative relations of the energy efficiencies are measured and analyzed under the moderate discharging situation. The results show a negative quadratic correlation between energy efficiency and rate, and exhibit a reduction in energy efficiency as rate increases. Lastly, a test with several consecutive hybrid pulse power characteristic test profiles is carried. The experimental results indicate that the correction of SOC0 can efficiently limit the error below 4{\%}, and also exhibit that considering on the effect of energy efficiency can further reduce its estimation error.

abstract = {A 1D electrochemical, lumped thermal model is used to explore pulse power limitations and thermal behavior of a 6Ah, 72 cell, 276V nominal Li-ion hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) battery pack. Depleted/saturated active material Li surface concentrations in the negative/positive electrodes consistently cause end of high-rate (∼25C) pulse discharge at the 2.7Vcell−1 minimum limit, indicating solid-state diffusion is the limiting mechanism. The 3.9Vcell−1 maximum limit, meant to protect the negative electrode from lithium deposition side reaction during charge, is overly conservative for high-rate (∼15C) pulse charges initiated from states-of-charge (SOCs) less than 100{\%}. Two-second maximum pulse charge rate from the 50{\%} SOC initial condition can be increased by as much as 50{\%} without risk of lithium deposition. Controlled to minimum/maximum voltage limits, the pack meets partnership for next generation vehicles (PNGV) power assist mode pulse power goals (at operating temperatures {\textgreater}16°C), but falls short of the available energy goal. In a vehicle simulation, the pack generates heat at a 320W rate on a US06 driving cycle at 25°C, with more heat generated at lower temperatures. Less aggressive FUDS and HWFET cycles generate 6–12 times less heat. Contact resistance ohmic heating dominates all other mechanisms, followed by electrolyte phase ohmic heating. Reaction and electronic phase ohmic heats are negligible. A convective heat transfer coefficient of h=10.1Wm−2K−1 maintains cell temperature at or below the 52°C PNGV operating limit under aggressive US06 driving.},

abstract = {The modular multilevel converter (MMC) is one of the most potential converter topologies for medium/high power/voltage applications. One of the main technical challenges of an MMC is to eliminate/minimize the circulating currents within the legs. Circulating currents, if not properly controlled, increase the amplitude of capacitor voltage variations, rating values of the converter components and converter losses. This paper proposes a closed-loop circulating current control strategy for an MMC to specifically minimize the amplitude of capacitor voltage variations. The proposed strategy is based on adding an offset signal to the modulating signal of each arm. To minimize the amplitude of the capacitor voltage oscillations, an optimal circulating current component is determined and used as a reference signal for the current control of each MMC leg. Performance of the proposed control strategy is evaluated based on simulation studies in the MATLAB/Simulink environment. The reported study results demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed strategy to reduce the amplitude of the capacitor voltage oscillations.},

The Z-source converter employs a unique impedance network (or circuit) to couple the converter main circuit to the power source, thus providing unique features that cannot be obtained in the traditional voltage-source (or voltage-fed) and current-source (or current-fed) converters where a capacitor and inductor are used respectively. The Z-source converter overcomes the conceptual and theoretical barriers and limitations of the traditional voltage-source converter (abbreviated as V-source converter) and current-source converter (abbreviated as I-source converter) and provides a novel power conversion concept. The Z-source concept can be applied to all DC-to-AC, AC-to-DC, AC-to-AC, and DC-to-DC power conversion. To describe the operating principle and control, this paper focuses on an example: a Z-source inverter for DC-AC power conversion needed in fuel cell applications. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the new features.},

abstract = {Systems integration issues, such as electrical and thermal design and management of full battery packs - often containing hundreds of cells - have been rarely explored in the academic literature. In this paper we discuss the design and construction of a 9 kWh battery pack for a motorsports application. The pack contained 504 lithium cells arranged into 2 sidepods, each containing 3 modules, with each module in a 12P7S configuration. This paper focuses particularly on testing the full battery pack and diagnosing subsequent problems related to cells being connected in parallel. We demonstrate how a full vehicle test can be used to identify malfunctioning strings of cells for further investigation. After individual cell testing it was concluded that a single high inter-cell contact resistance was causing currents to flow unevenly within the pack, leading to cells being unequally worked. This is supported by a Matlab/Simulink model of one battery module, including contact resistances. Over time the unequal current flowing through cells can lead to significant differences in cells' state of charge and open circuit voltages, large currents flowing between cells even when the load is disconnected, cells discharging and aging more quickly than others, and jeopardise capacity and lifetime of the pack. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Substantially reduced energy and power capabilities of lithium-ion cell operating at low temperatures pose a technical barrier for market penetration of hybrid electric vehicles and pure electric vehicles. The present work delineates Li-ion cell behaviors at low temperatures by a combined experimental and modeling approach. An electrochemical-thermal coupled model, incorporating concentration- and temperature-dependent transport and kinetic properties, is applied and validated against 2.2Ah 18650 cylindrical cells over a wide range of temperatures (−20◦Cto45◦C) and discharge rates. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the dramatic effects of cell self-heating upon electrochemical performance.Anonisothermal Ragone plot accounting for these important thermal effects is proposed for the first time for Li-ion cells and more generally for thermally coupled batteries. Detailed resistance analysis indicates that performance limits at −20◦C depend on not only discharge rates but also thermal conditions. Optimization of cell design parameters and material properties is performed for 1 C rate discharge starting from −20◦C, where the principal performance limitations are found to be Li+ diffusion in the electrolyte and solid-state Li diffusion in graphite particles, instead of charge-transfer kinetic or ohmic resistance.},

abstract = {Advanced battery management systems are essential for efficient electrification of vehicles. Correct state of charge (SOC) estimates will maintain a battery within its charge limits and extend its usable life. Existing SOC algorithms for high-power Li-polymer batteries are not capable of accuracies greater than 95{\%} in realistic operating conditions. This thesis proposes the use of a reduced order electrochemical model with error correction to achieve that accuracy target in the current range of 1-5C with various load profiles and ambient temperature (Tamb) range of 0-40°C. Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) and electric vehicle (EV) drivers deserve to precisely know their remaining driving range and should not have to worry about premature battery pack exhaustion or failure. Coulomb counting, equivalent circuit model, and electrochemical model approaches are evaluated based on their deviation from a standard open circuit voltage curve. The equivalent circuit is a 2nd order Randle circuit and the electrochemical model is a single particle model. Order reduction was accomplished by assuming that reaction current is not influenced by the electrolyte concentration, the Butler-Volmer equation may be linearized, and ion conductivity is constant. Two methods are proposed; one based on empirical data and one based on a closed-loop feedback system. In the first method, error rates are calculated depending on operating current rate and ambient temperature and are then applied to the reduced order electrochemical model SOC estimates during constant current and pulse loading. In the second method, model SOC estimates are updated continuously by comparing the model terminal voltage estimate to battery terminal voltage measurements with a variable gain. Performance during charge-depleting and charge-sustaining modes is investigated. This thesis is the first to document SOC estimation performance of an equivalent circuit model and electrochemical model at ambient temperatures other than 25°C or room temperature. Also pioneered is the exploration of high current rates, charging efficiency computations as a function of temperature, and use of an open circuit voltage curve as a comparison tool rather than coulomb counting. The model error characterization and minimization techniques employed are novel as is the ROM feedback error compensation technique.},

abstract = {A two-dimensional, transient heat-transfer model for different methods of heat dissipation is used to simulate the temperature distribution in lithium-ion batteries. The experimental and simulation results show that cooling by natural convection is not an effective means for removing heat from the battery system. It is found that forced convection cooling can mitigate temperature rise in the battery. Nevertheless, a non-uniform distribution of temperature on the surface of the battery is inevitable and this makes thermal management difficult. As a better means of suppressing increases in temperature, a heat pipe has been used to effect heat dissipation. The connection between the heat pipe and the battery wall pays an important role in heat dissipation. Inserting the heat pipe in to an aluminum fin appears to be suitable for reducing the rise in temperature and maintaining a uniform temperature distribution on the surface of the battery. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Soft-switching converters equipped with insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) in silicon (Si) have to be dimensioned with respect to additional losses due to the dynamic conduction losses originating from the conductivity modulation lag. Replacing the IGBTs with emerging silicon carbide (SiC) transistors could reduce not only the dynamic conduction losses but also other loss components of the IGBTs. In the present paper, therefore, several types of SiC transistors are compared to a state-of-the-art 1200-V Si IGBT. First, the conduction losses with sinusoidal current at a fixed amplitude (150 A) are investigated at different frequencies up to 200 kHz. It was found that the SiC transistors showed no signs of dynamic conduction losses in the studied frequency range. Second, the SiC transistors were compared to the Si IGBT in a realistic soft-switching converter test system. Using a calorimetric approach, it was found that all SiC transistors showed loss reductions of more than 50{\%}. In some cases loss reductions of 65{\%} were achieved even if the chip area of the SiC transistor was only 11{\%} of that of the Si IGBT. It was concluded that by increasing the chip area to a third of the Si IGBT, the SiC vertical trench junction field-effect transistor could yield a loss reduction of approximately 90{\%}. The reverse conduction capability of the channel of unipolar devices is also identified to be an important property for loss reductions. A majority of the new SiC devices are challenging from a gate/base driver point-of-view. This aspect must also be taken into consideration when making new designs of soft-switching converters using new SiC transistors. {\textcopyright}2013 IEEE.},

Side reactions at the lithium electrode can change the surface concentration of lithium ions, introducing error into measurements of the cell potential as a function of bulk electrolyte concentration (concentration-cell measurements). This error introduced by a continuous side reaction is carried over into calculations of the transference number from the galvanostatic polarization method. Concentration gradients formed during passage of current are associated with a heat-of-mixing effect, which is the cause of heat generation during relaxation after cessation of the current. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations show that the decrease in conductivity with increasing salt concentration in liquid carbonate electrolytes is caused by ion association. {\textcopyright}2003 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

The SEI on the solution-side surface of the basal plane contains much more organic materials than that of the cross-section one. The SEI on the HOPG can be described as non-homogeneous. The SEI cross-section is dominated by Li and F, with one to several dozen micron-sized regions where Li and F are almost absent.

abstract = {A general framework to study the mechanical behaviour of a cylindrical silicon anode particle in a lithium ion battery as it undergoes lithiation is presented. The two-way coupling between stress and concentration of lithium in silicon, including the possibility of plastic deformation, is taken into account and two particular cases are considered. First, the cylindrical particle is assumed to be free of surface traction and second, the axial deformation of the cylinder is prevented. In both cases plastic stretches develop through the entire cylinder and not just near the surface as is commonly found in spherical anode particles. It is shown that the stress evolution depends both on the lithiation rate and the external constraints. Furthermore, as the cylinder expands during lithiation it can develop a compressive axial stress large enough to induce buckling, which in turn may lead to mechanical failure. An explicit criterion for swelling-induced buckling obtained as a modification of the classical Euler buckling criterion shows the competition between the stabilising effect of radius increase and the destabilising effect of axial stress.},

For high voltage applications, batteries cells are connected in series, raising the issue of voltage balancing among cells. This paper presents a new structure of active voltage balancing of Li-ion cells associated in series in battery stack. It is based on the use of micro-converters network. The principle of the charge equalization is to derive energy from an overcharged cell and to transfer it to an undercharged cell no matter whether the battery is currently in charge or in use supplying a load. The highlight of this structure is not only its high efficiency and its ease of implement but moreover, its integration capacity in contrast to state of the art passive and active balancing topologies. A monitoring system is required to perform forced balancing.

The analysis of the battery thermal management system (BTMS) design by using the numerical model is conducted for air and liquid type BTMSs. From the numerical analysis, it is found that a wide battery module with a small cell to cell gap is desirable for the air type BTMS while a narrow battery module with a small gap is desirable for a liquid type BTMS. The results also show that the air type BTMS consumes much more power compared with the liquid type BTMS especially for high heat load condition.

abstract = {Lithium ion batteries are in widespread use in consumer electronics. As electric vehicles enter the U.S. marketplace, there is an expectation of a step increase in the number and size of battery packs in storage and use. The Foundation's Property Insurance Research Group initiated a study of the hazards associated with lithium ion battery storage, with an aim of developing fire protection strategies to mitigate loss associated with fire incidence with these batteries in bulk storage and distribution, alone and in manufactured products. The overall aim is to develop the technical basis for requirements in NFPA and other standards which prescribe protection requirements. The first phase of the project, described in this report, is a literature review of battery technology, failure modes and events, usage, codes and standards, and a hazard assessment during the life cycle of storage and distribution. It lays out a research approach toward evaluating appropriate facility fire protection strategies},

abstract = {Battery thermal management is critical in achieving performance and extended life of batteries in electric and hybrid vehicles under real driving conditions. Appropriate modeling for predicting thermal behavior of battery systems in vehicles helps to make decisions for improved design and shortens the development process. For this paper, we looked at the impact of cooling strategies with air and both direct and indirect liquid cooling. The simplicity of an air battery cooling system is an advantage over a liquid coolant system. In addition to lower heat transfer coefficient, the disadvantage of air cooling is that the small heat capacity of air makes it difficult to accomplish temperature uniformity inside a cell or between cells in a module. Liquid cooling systems are more effective in heat transfer and take up less volume, but the added complexity and cost may outweigh the merits. Surface heat transfer coefficient, h, and the blower power for air cooling are sensitive to the hydraulic diameter of the channel (Dh). However, because of the added thermal resistances, h evaluated at cell surface is not as sensitive to the variation of Dh in a water/glycol jacket cooling system. Due to the high heat transfer coefficient at small Dh and large coolant flow rate, direct liquid cooling using dielectric mineral oil may be preferred in spite of high pressure loss in certain circumstances such as in highly transient large heat generating battery systems. Results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model simulation imply that capturing the internal heat flow paths and thermal resistances inside a cell using a sophisticated three-dimensional cell model are important for the improved prediction of cell/battery thermal behaviors. This paper identified analyses and approaches that engineers should consider when they design a battery thermal management system for vehicles.},

Measurement errors can be introduced in particular by the probes or by instruments that are transparent to high dv/dt and di/dt rates. For this reason, the use of bulky and expensive set-up's is often required. We present a simple method based on a micromachined dual-sensor heat-flux measurement device, coupled to a readout circuit, that allows the estimation by calorimetry of the dissipated power. By means of a controlled Peltier heat pump, the switching device is held at room temperature in order to minimise the heat exchanged with the ambient and improve therefore the precision of the measurement. The sensor could be in principle integrated within the switching device case itself, to allow the lifelong monitoring of the produced heat.},

abstract = {The polarization processes occurring at the electrode–electrolyte interfaces of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectra measured at single cells under realistic operating conditions. The approach presented is based on distributions of relaxation times which are the basic quantity of interest in electrochemical impedance data analysis. A deconvolution method was developed and implemented that yields these characteristic distribution patterns directly from the impedance spectra. In contrast to nonlinear least squares curve fit of equivalent circuit models, no a priori circuit choice has to be made. Even more importantly, the excellent resolving capacity allows the untangling of the impedance contributions of up to three physically distinct processes within one frequency decade. With the method, processes with the highest polarization losses can be identified and targeted to improve cell performance. Based on the distributions, a general strategy for the identification of the reaction mechanisms is given. The evaluation of the distributions in terms of peak parameters is illustrated by a physical model for oxygen reduction at the SOFC cathode–electrolyte interface. The method is expected to find many applications in electrochemistry beyond the field of solid oxide fuel cell development.},

We find a slight increase in the diffusivity as the temperature increases and since diffusion is noticeable at high temperatures, Li-ion diffusion in the range of 1300 K to 1800 K was also studied and the diffusion mechanisms involved in each SEI compound were analyzed. We observed that the predominant mechanisms of Li-ion diffusion included vacancy assisted and knock-off diffusion in LiF, direct exchange in Li2O, and vacancy and knock-off in Li2CO3. Moreover, we also evaluated the effect of applied electric fields in the diffusion of Li-ions at room temperature.},

There are three essential components in a positive electrode laminate: active material (AM) particles, acetylene black (AB) particles, and the polymer binder. The high filler content and discrete particle sizes make the electrode laminate a very unique polymer composite. This work introduces a physical model in which AB and AM particles compete for polymer binder, which forms fixed layers of polymer on their surfaces. This competition leads to the observed variations in electrode morphology and performance for different electrode formulations. The electronic conductivities of the cathode laminates were measured and compared to an effective conductivity calculation based on the physical model to probe the interaction among the three components to reveal the critical factors controlling electrode conductivity and electrochemical performance. The data and effective conductivity calculation results agree very well with each other. This developed physical model provides a theoretical guideline for optimization of electrode composition for most polymer binder-based Li-ion battery electrodes.},

abstract = {The mechanism of Li(+) transport through the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), a passivating film on electrode surfaces, has never been clearly elucidated despite its overwhelming importance to Li-ion battery operation and lifetime. The present paper develops a multiscale theoretical methodology to reveal the mechanism of Li(+) transport in a SEI film. The methodology incorporates the boundary conditions of the first direct diffusion measurements on a model SEI consisting of porous (outer) organic and dense (inner) inorganic layers (similar to typical SEI films). New experimental evidence confirms that the inner layer in the ∼20 nm thick model SEI is primarily crystalline Li(2)CO(3). Using density functional theory, we first determined that the dominant diffusion carrier in Li(2)CO(3) below the voltage range of SEI formation is excess interstitial Li(+). This diffuses via a knock-off mechanism to maintain higher O-coordination, rather than direct-hopping through empty spaces in the Li(2)CO(3) lattice. Mesoscale diffusion equations were then formulated upon a new two-layer/two-mechanism model: pore diffusion in the outer layer and knock-off diffusion in the inner layer. This diffusion model predicted the unusual isotope ratio (6)Li(+)/(7)Li(+) profile measured by TOF-SIMS, which increases from the SEI/electrolyte surface and peaks at a depth of 5 nm, and then gradually decreases within the dense layer. With no fitting parameters, our approach is applicable to model general transport properties, such as ionic conductivity, for SEI films on the surface of other electrodes, from the atomic scale to the mesoscale, as well as aging phenomenon.},

In this study, a numerical model and an analytical model for the thermal management of lithium ion battery stacks are developed to investigate the thermal behaviors of flat-plate and cylindrical stacks during discharging processes. It is found that for the same volume ratio of cooling channel and battery of flat-plate design, changing the channel size and the number of channels results in similar average battery temperatures, however, increasing the channel size improves the cooling energy efficiency but leads to more unevenly distributed temperature, and vice versa. The volume ratio of cooling channel to battery needs to be higher than 0.014 for flat-plate design when the Reynolds number of cooling air is around 2000 or higher with a high discharging rate of 2 C. The cylindrical battery stacks considered in this study are generally less compact and more energy-efficient in cooling than the flat-plate battery stacks, and the general thermal behaviors are similar between these two designs.

The proposed strategy balances the submodule capacitor voltages to track their reference values with low voltage ripple in a wide range of switching frequencies. It remarkably enhances the converter system reliability, especially for a large number of submodules, because the need to measure the submodule capacitor voltages in each arm is eliminated. The proposed hierarchical PCC algorithm is decoupled from other standard control loops in an MMC. Digital time-domain simulation studies are conducted on a 21-level MMC to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in high and low switching frequencies under balanced and unbalanced load conditions. In addition, the proposed method is implemented in the FPGA-based RT-LAB real-time simulator platform to validate its performance in a hardware-in-the-loop setup.},

abstract = {We demonstrate, in three different rechargeable lithium-ion cells, the existence of an intrinsic relationship between a cell's internal temperature and a readily measurable electrical parameter, namely the phase shift between an applied sinusoidal current and the resulting voltage. The temperature range examined spanned from -20 to 66 ??C. The optimum single frequency for the phase measurement is in the 40-100 Hz range, allowing for a measurement time of much less than a second; the phase shift in this range depends predominantly on temperature, and is almost completely independent of the state-of-charge. Literature reports suggest that the observed dependence of the phase shift on temperature arises from the ionic conduction of the so-called solid-electrolyte-interphase layer between the graphite anode and the electrolyte. A meter measuring the phase shift across this interphase is analogous to a thermometer reporting the temperature, thereby providing feedback for rapid corrections of any operating conditions that might lead to the catastrophic destruction of the cell. This level of monitoring and control is distinctly different from the present safety-enabling mechanisms: typically positive thermal coefficient ceramics/plastics, or "shutdown" separators based on polyethylene that act to often permanently shut down current flow through the cell. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Theoretical calculations are compared with well-controlled experiments conducted on a high-surface area, small diameter lithiated-carbon electrodes. The electrodes are shown to yield very high current densities and exhibit little interfacial kinetics resistance or intercalate diffusion resistance. The mathematical treatment describes quantitatively a wide range of electrochemical experiments. The application of the model to the experimental data is facilitated by the use of a reference electrode. Initial cycling behavior of the high-surface-area electrode is elucidated, including clarification of the first-cycle coulombic inefficiency. Nitrogen absorbtion and scanning electron micrographs are utilized to ascertain the microstructural characteristics that distinguish the active electrode material. An asymptotic analysis is used to indicate when diffusion resistance within host particles is negligible; this fact simplifies model calculations and contributes to our overall understanding of insertion processes associated with host particles of very small dimensions. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {In this article, we develop a micro-macroscopic coupled model aimed at studying the interplay between electrokinetics and transport in lithium ion batteries. The system studied consists of a solid (electrode material) and a liquid phase (electrolyte) with periodic microscopic features. In this work, homogenization of generalized Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equation set leads to a micro/macro formulation similar in nature to the one developed in Newman's model for lithium batteries. Underlying conservation equations are derived for each phase using asymptotic expansions and mathematical tools from homogenization theory, starting from a PNP micromodel, and in particular Newman's model is obtained as a corollary of the micro/macro approach developed here. The advantage of homogenization lies in the fact that effective parameters can be derived directly from the analysis of the periodic microstructure and from the application of the theory developed in this article. In addition, the advantages of using homogenization in Lithium ion battery modeling are outlined. Lastly, this work is a necessary step toward more general homogenized models and toward mathematical proofs, and it is also needed preliminary analysis for multiscale computational schemes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This study focused on losses at the negative electrode and the data were fit to a model which involved a rate-determining step governed by electronic conductivity of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer, following Arrhenius' law as a function of temperature.

abstract = {The paper suggests an energy management control strategy of wayside Li-ion capacitor (LiC) based energy storage for light railway vehicles (LRV). The installation of wayside supercapacitor (SC) storage devices, as widely recognized, allows the recovery of the braking energy for increasing the system efficiency as well as a better pantograph voltage profile. A new type of SC, LiC, interfaced with dc-interleaved converter has been presented. This technology has an energy density comparable to batteries and power density much higher than the batteries. The authors propose a control strategy based on the maximum kinetic energy recovery throughout braking operations of the running vehicles. The stored energy comes back to the vehicles during the accelerations. The strategy stays on the knowledge of the state of charge of LiC device and the actual vehicle speeds. In particular, the control algorithm evaluates, in real time, the actual value of LiC voltage and current references on the basis of the vehicles inertial forces and acceleration estimations, taking into account the power losses of the system. Experimental tests made on electromechanical simulator, equipped with a 136-V, 30.5-F LiC module, fully confirm the validity of the suggested control. Finally, experimental characterization of LiC module has been achieved.},

Real-time state and parame- ter information enables operation near physical limits without compromising durability, thereby unlocking the full potential of battery energy storage. SOC/SOH estimation is technically challenging because battery dynamics are governed by electrochemical prin- ciples, mathematically modeled by PDEs. We cast this problem as a simultaneous state (SOC) and parameter (SOH) estimation design for a linear PDE with a nonlinear output mapping. Several new theoretical ideas are developed, integrated together, and tested. These include a backstepping PDE state estimator, a Pad? e-based parameter identifier, nonlinear parameter sensitivity analysis, and adaptive inversion of nonlinear output functions. The key novelty of this design is a combined SOC/SOH battery estimation algo- rithm that identifies physical system variables, from measurements of voltage and current only. [DOI:},

abstract = { We consider the problem of constructing optimal decentralized controllers. We formulate this problem as one of minimizing the closed-loop norm of a feedback system subject to constraints on the controller structure. We define the notion of quadratic invariance of a constraint set with respect to a system, and show that if the constraint set has this property, then the constrained minimum-norm problem may be solved via convex programming. We also show that quadratic invariance is necessary and sufficient for the constraint set to be preserved under feedback. These results are developed in a very general framework, and are shown to hold in both continuous and discrete time, for both stable and unstable systems, and for any norm. This notion unifies many previous results identifying specific tractable decentralized control problems, and delineates the largest known class of convex problems in decentralized control. As an example, we show that optimal stabilizing controllers may be efficiently computed in the case where distributed controllers can communicate faster than their dynamics propagate. We also show that symmetric synthesis is included in this classification, and provide a test for sparsity constraints to be quadratically invariant, and thus amenable to convex synthesis.},

abstract = {The paper studies average consensus with random topologies (intermittent links) and noisy channels. Consensus with noise in the network links leads to the bias-variance dilemma-running consensus for long reduces the bias of the final average estimate but increases its variance. We present two different compromises to this tradeoff: the A-ND algorithm modifies conventional consensus by forcing the weights to satisfy a persistence condition (slowly decaying to zero;) and the A-NC algorithm where the weights are constant but consensus is run for a fixed number of iterations [{\^{}}(iota)], then it is restarted and rerun for a total of [{\^{}}(p)] runs, and at the end averages the final states of the [{\^{}}(p)] runs (Monte Carlo averaging). We use controlled Markov processes and stochastic approximation arguments to prove almost sure convergence of A-ND to a finite consensus limit and compute explicitly the mean square error (mse) (variance) of the consensus limit. We show that A-ND represents the best of both worlds-zero bias and low variance-at the cost of a slow convergence rate; rescaling the weights balances the variance versus the rate of bias reduction (convergence rate). In contrast, A-NC, because of its constant weights, converges fast but presents a different bias-variance tradeoff. For the same number of iterations [{\^{}}(iota)][{\^{}}(p)] , shorter runs (smaller [{\^{}}(iota)] ) lead to high bias but smaller variance (larger number [{\^{}}(p)] of runs to average over.) For a static nonrandom network with Gaussian noise, we compute the optimal gain for A-NC to reach in the shortest number of iterations [{\^{}}(iota)][{\^{}}(p)] , with high probability (1-delta), (epsiv, delta)-consensus (epsiv residual bias). Our results hold under fairly general assumptions on the random link failures and communication noise.},

abstract = {Primary lithium batteries contain hazardous materials such as lithium metal and flammable solvents, which can lead to exothermic activity and runaway reactions above a defined temperature. Lithium-ion batteries operating outside the safe envelope can also lead to formation of lithium metal and thermal runaway. Despite protection by battery safety mechanisms, fires originating from primary lithium and lithium-ion batteries are a relatively frequent occurrence. This paper reviews the hazards associated with primary lithium and lithium-ion cells, with an emphasis on the role played by chemistry at individual cell level. Safety mechanisms to prevent the occurrence and limit the consequences of incidents are reviewed, together with safety tests to monitor compliance with battery safety regulations and standards. Incident information from news accounts and open literature sources are reviewed to extract causal information. It is concluded that the potential severity of incidents during storage, transport and recycling of waste batteries can be significantly higher than in end-use applications. Safe storage, packaging and labelling practices, as well as communication among the parties involved, are essential to ensure safety across the battery lifecycle. It is recommended that a database of lithium battery incidents would be valuable to improve the evidence base for informing accident prevention measures.

abstract = {Open-circuit voltage (OCV) is widely used to estimate the state-of-charge (SoC) in many SoC estimation algorithms. However, the relationship between the OCV and SoC cannot be exactly same for all batteries. Because the conventional OCV-SoC differs among batteries, there is a problem in that the relationship of the OCV-SoC should be measured to estimate accurately the SoC. Therefore, a modified OCV-SoC relationship based on the conventional OCV-SoC is proposed. Problems resulting from the defects of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) can be avoided by preventing the relationship from varying. Also, in order to improve the performance of the algorithm, measurement noise models of the Kalman filter are applied. Thus, the measurement noise models allow the Kalman filter to overcome defects from the simplified battery modelling and to separate the sequence for estimation of the state and weight filter. The SoC and the capacity of a lithium-ion battery are estimated using the dual EKF with the proposed method. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Elastomers and soft biological tissues can undergo large deformations and exhibit time dependent behavior that is characteristic of nonlinear viscoelastic solids. This article is intended to provide an overview of the subject of nonlinear viscoelastic solids for researchers who are interested in studying the mechanics of these materials. The article begins with a review of topics from linear viscoelasticity that are pertinent to the understanding of nonlinear viscoelastic behavior. It then discusses the topics that enter into the formulation of constitutive equations for isotropic, transversely isotropic and orthotropic nonlinear viscoelastic solids. A number of specific forms of constitutive equations have been proposed in the literature and these are discussed. Attention is restricted to constitutive equations that are phenomenological rather than molecular in origin. The emphasis is then on nonlinear single integral finite linear viscoelastic and Pipkin—Rogers constitutive equations, the latter containing the quasi-linear viscoelastic model used in biomechanics of soft tissue. Expressions for the Pipkin—Rogers model are provided for isotropy, transverse isotropy and orthotropy. The constitutive equations are then applied to the description of homogeneous triaxial stretch and simple shear histories. The special case of uniaxial stretch histories is analyzed in detail. There is a discussion of the deviation from linear behavior as nonlinear effects become important. Non-homogeneous deformations are considered next. The combined tension and torsion of a solid cylinder on an incompressible, isotropic nonlinear viscoelastic solid is discussed in detail because of its importance in experiments involving viscoelastic materials. A large number of solutions to boundary value problems have appeared in the literature and many of these are summarized. The article concludes with comments about interesting topics for further research.},

abstract = {Abstract 484 new and 1908 aged lithium-ion cells out of two identical battery electric vehicles (i.e. 954 cells each) were characterized by capacity and impedance measurements to yield a broad set of data for distribution fit analysis. Results prove alteration from normal to Weibull distribution for the parameters of lithium-ion cells with the progress of aging. Cells with abnormal characteristics in the aged state mostly exhibit lower capacities as compared to the distribution mode which is typical for the left-skewed Weibull shape. In addition, the strength of variation and the amount of outliers both are generally increased with the aging progress. Obtained results are compared to vehicles' operational data to provide recommendations with the aim to minimize the increasing parameter spread. However, neither temperature gradients in the battery pack nor an insufficient balancing procedure were determined. As the appearance of cells with suspicious parameters could not be assigned to local weak spots of the battery pack, a random and inevitable type of origin is assumed. Hence, the battery management system must ensure to detect outliers in a reliable manner and to balance resulting drifts of cells' states of charge to guarantee a safe battery storage operation.},

abstract = {Swelling of a commercial 5 Ah lithium-ion cell with a nickel/manganese/ cobalt-oxide cathode is investigated as a function of the charge state and the charge/discharge rate. In combination with sensitive displacement measurements, knowledge of the electrode configuration within this prismatic cell's interior allows macroscopic deformations of the casing to be correlated to electrochemical and mechanical transformations in individual anode/separator/cathode layers. Thermal expansion and interior charge state are both found to cause significant swelling. At low rates, where thermal expansion is negligible, the electrode sandwich dilates by as much as 1.5{\%} as the charge state swings from 0{\%} to 100{\%} because of lithium-ion intercalation. At high rates a comparably large residual swelling was observed at the end of discharge. Thermal expansion caused by joule heating at high discharge rate results in battery swelling. The changes in displacement with respect to capacity at low rate correlate well with the potential changes known to accompany phase transitions in the electrode materials. Although the potential response changes minimally with the C-rate, the extent of swelling varies significantly, suggesting that measurements of swelling may provide a sensitive gauge for characterizing dynamic operating states. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We suggest that the lithiation of pristine SnO forms a layered LiXO structure, while the expelled tin atoms agglomerate into "surface" planes separating the LiXO layers. The proposed lithiation model widely differs from the common assumption that tin segregates into nanoclusters embedded in the lithia matrix. With this model, we are able to account for the various tin bonds that are seen experimentally and explain the three volume expansion phases that occur when SnO undergoes lithiation: (i) at low concentrations Li behaves as an intercalated species inducing small volume increases; (ii) for intermediate concentrations SnO transforms into lithia causing a large expansion; and (iii) finally, as the Li concentration further increases a saturation of the lithia takes place until a layered Li2O is formed. A moderate volume expansion results from this last process. We also report a "zipper" nucleation mechanism that could provide the seed for the transformation from tin oxide to lithium oxide.},

Based on the analysis of the impedance spectra obtained by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), a simplified battery impedance model is derived with the constant phase element (CPE). To interpret the impedance model, a fractional order calculus (FOC) method is introduced to model the CPE in the impedance model. A new identification method is proposed to identify the impedance model, considering both accuracy and simplicity. The fractional Kalman filter is introduced to estimate the SOC of the lithium-ion battery based on the impedance model. Finally, a battery test bench is established, and the proposed method is verified by a scaled down system on the urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) drive cycle test. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

At first, a two-dimensional simulation code for a cylindrical battery is developed, and the simulation results for a commercially available small size battery are compared with the corresponding experimental results. The simulation results of the transient temperature and voltage variations coincide very well with the experimental results. The simulation result of the temperature difference between the center of the battery body and the center of the battery side is also in reasonable agreement with the experimental result. Next, the authors develop a three-dimensional simulation code and perform numerical simulations for three large size prismatic batteries with the same capacity and different cross sectional shapes. It is made clear that selecting the battery with the laminated cross section has a remarkable effect on the suppression of the temperature rise in comparison with the battery with square cross section, whereas the effect of the lamination on the suppression of the temperature unevenness is unexpectedly small. These results indicate the accuracy and usefulness of the developed simulation codes. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In the failed cell, the maximum separation of the electrode assemblies was measured in each direction (XY = 833 ??m, YZ = 787 ??m), representing a significant increase from the untested cell, where the spacing was below 43 ??m. Deformation was more prominent in the central region of the cell since both ends of the battery electrodes remained tightly clamped even after failure. Based on the visually observed volume expansion and the deformation of the cell architecture observed by ??CT we conclude that the deformation was caused by pressure build up as a result of gas generation, which could have arisen from a short circuit in the cell. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

The model is used to predict the influence of cell design parameters such as thickness, porosity, and particle size of the electrodes on the magnitude of stress generation. The model developed in this study can be used to understand the mechanical degradation in a porous electrode during an intercalation/deintercalation process, and the use of this model results in an improved design for battery electrodes that are mechanically durable over an extended period of operation. {\textcopyright}},

Pulsating heat pipe may be more effective but needs to be well designed. In addition, progress in developing new high temperature material is very difficult. PCM for battery thermal management is a better selection than others.

abstract = {Limited battery power and poor engine efficiency at cold temperature results in low plug in hybrid vehicle (PHEV) fuel economy and high emissions. Quick rise of battery temperature is not only important to mitigate lithium plating and thus preserve battery life, but also to increase the battery power limits so as to fully achieve fuel economy savings expected from a PHEV. Likewise, it is also important to raise the engine temperature so as to improve engine efficiency (therefore vehicle fuel economy) and to reduce emissions. One method of increasing the temperature of either component is to maximize their usage at cold temperatures thus increasing cumulative heat generating losses. Since both components supply energy to meet road load demand, maximizing the usage of one component would necessarily mean low usage and slow temperature rise of the other component. Thus, a natural trade-off exists between battery and engine warm-up. This paper compares energy management strategies for a power-split PHEV for their ability to warm -up the battery and the engine, and ultimately the resulting fuel economy. The engine model predicts engine fuel rate as a function of engine utilization history and starting temperature, apart from speed and torque. The battery temperature rise model is a function of battery utilization. Engine and battery utilization is varied by changing the control parameter - wheel power demand at which the engine turns ON. The paper analyses the sensitivity of fuel and electrical energy consumption to engine and battery temperature rise, for different driving distances and driver aggressivenes},

abstract = {The relationship between the elevated temperature performance of Li/graphite half-cells and the composition and morphology of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on the graphite surface has been investigated for two electrolyte systems: 1 M LiPF 6 in ethylene carbonate/dimethyl carbonate EC/DMC (2:1) and 1 M LiBF 4 in EC/DMC (2:1). Precycled cells were stored at different temperatures up to 80°C, and the graphite electrodes were analyzed chemically (by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and electrochemically under continued cycling. Loss of charge (for both salts) and of intercalation capacity (for LiBF 4 ) occurred after elevated temperature storage. The charge loss could be coupled to disappearance of the R ­ OCO 2 Li phase from the surface, with subsequent exposure of the graphite surface. The amount of LiF increased with increased storage temperature, but the LiF morphology differed between the two electrolyte systems. A model for the morphological changes of the SEI layer on storage at elevated temperature is proposed. {\textcopyright} 2001 The Electrochemical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In this paper, the recovered heat is examined for cabin cooling for ejector and absorption cooling cycles. Energy and exergy analyses are conducted to study the role of various design parameters on the cooling capacity. Waste heat from the battery pack, as well from exhaust gases in the Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) mode, are the inputs for the boiler and generator. In a city driving mode, waste heat of 15.4 kW will be available. Results show that transferring this waste heat to the boiler in the ejector cooling system leads to a cooling effect of 7.23 kW, with energetic and exergetic Coefficients of Performance (COPs) of 0.48 and 0.2 respectively. In the absorption cycle, the energetic COP of the system is 0.53 with a coolant capacity of 7.93 kW. Results also show that, for the electric mode, the cooling capacity is lower than 2 kW, which is insufficient to provide cooling. While recovered heat from Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEV) can be used for vehicle cabin cooling by both ejector and absorption systems, the analysis shows that the latter system has a better coefficient of performance and cooling capacity than the ejector system. {\textcopyright}2012.},

abstract = {An advanced model is proposed, describing the capacity losses of C6/LiFePO4 batteries under storage and cycling conditions. These capacity losses are attributed to the growth of a Solid Electrolyte Interface (SEI) at the surface of graphite particles in the negative electrode. The model assumes the existence of an inner and outer SEI layer. The rate determining step is considered to be electron tunneling through the inner SEI layer. The inner SEI layer grows much slower than the outer SEI layer. Another contribution to the degradation process is the exfoliation of SEI near the edges of graphite particles during discharging and the formation of new SEI induced by the volumetric changes during the subsequent charging. The model has been validated by storage and cycling experiments. The simulation results show that the capacity losses are dependent on the State-of-Charge (SoC), the storage time, cycle number and graphite particle size. The model can be used to predict both the calendar and cycling life of the Li-ion batteries.},

abstract = {The future evolution of technological systems dedicated to improve energy efficiency will strongly depend on effective and reliable Energy Storage Systems, as key components for Smart Grids, microgrids and electric mobility. Besides possible improvements in chemical materials and cells design, the Battery Management System is the most important electronic device that improves the reliability of a battery pack. In fact, a precise State of Charge (SoC) estimation allows the energy flows controller to exploit better the full capacity of each cell. In this paper, we propose an alternative definition for the SoC, explaining the rationales by a mechanical analogy. We introduce a novel cell model, conceived as a series of three electric dipoles, together with a procedure for parameters estimation relying only on voltage measures and a given current profile. The three dipoles represent the quasi-stationary, the dynamics and the istantaneous components of voltage measures. An Extended Kalman Filer (EKF) is adopted as a nonlinear state estimator. Moreover, we propose a multi-cell EKF system based on a round-robin approach to allow the same processing block to keep track of many cells at the same time. Performance tests with a prototype battery pack composed by 18 A123 cells connected in series show encouraging results.},

abstract = {Batteries for stationary and automotive applications are required to provide extended cycle life and calendar life. Lithium-manganese oxides (LiMn2O4) with spinel structure and lithium-nickel-cobalt mixed oxides (LiNiCoO2) with layered structures have been extensively studied in the last few years for usage in high energy and high power batteries in order to replace lithium-cobalt oxide (LiCoO2) as cathode material in terms of cost, abundance and performance. In this paper, we summarize some basic mechanisms responsible for capacity fading under cycling and different storage conditions for both types of cathode materials. Lithium-nickel-cobalt mixed oxides show excellent storage stability in the discharged state and low metal solubility in the electrolyte. The cycling stability is mainly influenced by structural changes in the delithiated state and thermal instability arises from oxygen release at elevated temperatures in the charged state. Small amounts of aluminum and magnesium dopants stabilize the layered structure and increase cycling stability of lithium-nickel-cobalt oxide. Different mechanisms of capacity fading especially at higher temperatures are discussed for lithium-manganese oxide spinels. Capacity fading is highly dependent on cycling and storage conditions and caused by structural changes as well as by side reactions with electrolyte catalyzed by decomposition products of LiPF6 conducting salt and H2O impurities in the electrolyte. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Each cell consisted of thin layers of LiCoO 2, LiPON and Li on a ceramic substrate, and each layer was deposited by radio frequency (RF) + direct current (DC) hybrid magnetron sputtering, RF reactive sputtering, and thermal evaporation, respectively. In order to increase the effective surface area of the TFB in a limited small volume, 11 cells were stacked and connected in parallel. By designing the thermal switch with a heating source, its capacitor charging performance was well maintained, even at temperatures below -30 °C, as well as at room temperature. Charging to greater than 4 V was completed within 0.06 sec at room temperature and within 0.13 s at -30 ° C due to the heat-up process. A novel battery system consisting of the TFB module with a thermal switch and a heating source proved to be a promising substitute for the ampoule type reserve battery in small sized electrical fuses, even at very low temperatures. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The model introduces multiple coupled computational domains to resolve the interplay of lithium-ion battery physics in varied length scales. Model geometry decoupling and domain separation for the physicochemical process interplay are valid where the characteristic time or length scale is segregated. Assuming statistical homogeneity for repeated architectures typical of lithium-ion battery devices is often adequate and effective for modeling submodel geometries and physics in each domain. The modularized hierarchical architecture of the model provides a ﬂexible and expandable framework facilitating modeling of the multiphysics behavior of lithium-ion battery systems. In this paper, the Multi-Scale Multi-Dimensional model is introduced and applied to a model analysis that resolves electrochemical-, electrical-, and thermal-coupled physics in large-format stacked prismatic cell designs.},

@article{MacDonald2011,
abstract = {A review is presented of the history of the Point Defect Model (PDM) for the growth and breakdown of passive films that form on the surfaces of reactive metals in contact with corrosive, condensed phase environments. The PDM has passed through three generations, with each successive generation addressing issues that have arisen from experiment or theory. Thus, the first generation model (PDM-I), developed in the early 1980s, assumed that the passive film was a single defective oxide layer that contained cation vacancies and oxygen vacancies that were generated and annihilated at the metal/film and film/solution interfaces, as inspired by the work by Wagner on high temperature oxidation. As with gas-phase systems, the film was assumed not to dissolve. However, it soon became evident that this model could not account for the properties of the passive state on metals in contact with aqueous environments and, accordingly a Generation II model (PDM-II) was developed to address these issues. PDM-II incorporated the bi-layer structure of the film comprising a defective oxide or hydride barrier layer adjacent to the metal and an outer layer that forms by precipitation of material from reaction of transmitted cations with species in the environment (including water, CO32-, HS-, etc.), introduced metal interstitials to the suite of defects, recognized barrier layer dissolution, and recognized the need to classify reactions as to whether they are lattice conservative or non-conservative, but assumed that control of the passive current resided in the barrier layer alone. PDM-II has enjoyed considerable success and the author knows of no instance where it has been demonstrated to be at odds with experiment when confluence between experiment and theory has been demonstrated. A Generation III model (PDM-III) has been recently developed to extend the theory to those cases (e.g., the valve metals) where the outer layer is so resistive that it controls the impedance of the interface and hence the corrosion rate. A fourth generation model that will describe passivity on alloys is now under development. The experimental evidence upon which each generation is based is reviewed. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

Examples for their implementation and advantages and disadvantages are given. The models are based on: (a) physical and chemical processes and their interaction as regards ageing effects; (b) weighting of the Ah throughput whenever the operating conditions deviate from the standard conditions used for determining the lifetime under laboratory conditions; (c) an event-oriented concept from mechanical engineering (W??hler curves) which is based on a pattern recognition approach to identify severe operating conditions. Examples and details are explained for lead-acid batteries. The approaches can be applied to other electrochemical technologies including fuel cells. However, it is beyond the scope of this paper, to describe the models in all mathematical details.

abstract = {One of the most important aspects in battery management systems (BMS) in electric vehicles is the state of charge (SOC) estimation. SOC needs to be accurately determined for safety and performance reasons but cannot be measured directly due to the flatness and hysteresis of the open circuit voltage (OCV) curve of Lithium-ion chemistries as LiFePO4. The classical approach of current integration (Coulomb counting) cannot solve the problems of accumulative error and inaccurate initial values, thus advanced estimation algorithms are applied to determine the sate of charge. In this work, three model-based state observer designs including Luenberger observer, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Sigma Point Kalman Filter (SPKF) are carried out and studied. These estimation approaches are verified using measurement data acquired from commercial LiFePO4 cells. In addition, computational tests analyze the systems performances in terms of tracking accuracy, estimation robustness against temperature uncertainty, sensor drift, and convergence behavior with an initial SOC offset. ?? 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Recent advances in lithium-ion battery modeling suggest unequal but controlled and carefully timed charging of individual cells by reduce degradation. This paper compares anode-side film formation for a standard equalization scheme versus unequal charging through switches that are controlled by deterministic dynamic programming (DDP) and DDP-inspired heuristic algorithms. A static map for film growth rate is derived from a first-principles battery model adopted from the electrochemical engineering literature. Using this map, we consider two cells that are connected in parallel via relay switches. The key results are the following: 1) optimal unequal and delayed charging indeed reduces film buildup, and 2) a near-optimal state feedback controller can be designed from the DDP solution and film growth rate convexity properties. The simulation results indicate that the heuristic state feedback controller achieves near optimal performance relative to the DDP solution, with significant reduction in film growth compared to charging both cells equally, for several film growth models. Moreover, the algorithms achieve similar film reduction values on the full electrochemical model. These results correlate with the convexity properties of the film growth map. Hence, this paper demonstrates that unequal charging may indeed reduce film growth, given certain convexity properties exist, lending promise to the concept for improving battery pack life.},

All the modules independently estimate the grid voltage magnitude and position, and the modules are synchronized together over a controller area network (CAN) bus. The CAN bus is also used to interleave the pulsewidth modulation switching of the modules and synchronize the analog to digital converter (ADC) sampling.

An efficient thermal management system is also desirable to avoid diverting excessive power from the primary vehicle functions. In a battery cell stack, cooling can be provided by including cooling plates: thin metal fabrications which include one or more internal channels through which a coolant is pumped. Heat is conducted from the battery cells into the cooling plate, and transported away by the coolant. The operating characteristics of the cooling plate are determined in part by the geometry of the channel; its route, width, length, etc. In this study, a serpentine-channel cooling plate is modeled parametrically and its characteristics assessed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Objective functions of pressure drop, average temperature, and temperature uniformity are defined and numerical optimization is carried out by allowing the channel width and position to vary. The optimization results indicate that a single design can satisfy both pressure and average temperature objectives, but at the expense of temperature uniformity. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The secondary batteries for an electric vehicle (EV) generate much heat during rapid charge and discharge cycles, when the EV quickly starts consuming the battery power and suddenly stops recovering the inertia energy. The generated heat significantly increases the cell temperature and possibly leads to negative effects on the battery per- formance and the safety requirement. We have studied the thermal behavior of nickel/metal hydride (Ni/MH) batteries during rapid charge and discharge cycles, applying our previous battery thermal model, and found agreement with the experimental results at smaller charge current than the rated current. The heat sources by the entropy change, the hydrogen occlusion and the side reaction have been referred to the published data, and the overpotential resistance and the current efficiency, the ratio of main reaction current to charge current, have been measured experimentally through the rapid charge and discharge characteristics with constant current. By using these data our thermal model for the Ni/MH battery has estimated its temperature increase, which agrees well with the measured temperature rise, with a root mean square error of 1.5 and 2.1 °C for charge and discharge cycles, respectively.},

A battery pack containing 150 cylindrical type Li-Ion battery cells in a PVC casing is investigated. An equal number of tubes are used in the pack as a medium to cool the battery by using a fan when the vehicle is stationary or with ambient air when in motion. The parameters affecting the air cooling of battery are studied and optimized by considering their practical constraints. The objective function and Number of Transfer Unit (NTU) are developed. Finally, a genetic algorithm method is employed to optimize the decision variables. Analysing the results shows that NTU can be maximized by increasing the diameter of tubes on the battery and keeping the air velocity in a certain range.},

abstract = {Information on battery internal temperature is valuable to enhance the understanding of thermo-electrochemical reactions, to validate simulation models, and to refine battery thermal design. In this study, 12 thermocouples are embedded at strategically-chosen locations inside a 25 Ah laminated lithium-ion battery. Another 12 thermocouples are attached at the corresponding locations on the surface. The temporal and spatial variations of the temperature are measured at a series of discharge rates under different thermal conditions. The thermal response of these locations is also analyzed. The major findings include: First, the internal temperatures could differ from the surface for as large as 1.1 C, even for a thin laminated cell. Second, the time constants of thermal response at the internal locations are generally dozens of seconds larger than on the surface. Third, the internal variation in the plane direction reaches above 10 C under adiabatic 1.5 C discharge, much larger than in the through-plane direction, indicating the in-plane heat conductivity needs improvement. Finally, forced convection is effective to suppress the temperature rise as well as the variation. The direct measurement of internal temperature initiated in this study paves the way for implanting sensors/microchips in single cell to extract multiple physico-electrochemical signals simultaneously. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Reliable predictions of cell temperature and heat-generation rate are required for the design and thermal management of battery systems. The temperature of a cell changes as a result of electrochemical reactions, phase changes, mixing effects, and joule heating. The equation developed incorporates these effects in a complete and general manner. Simplifications and special cases are discussed. The results of applying the energy balance to a mathematical model of the LiAYFeS cell discharged through two different reaction mechanisms are given as examples. The examples illustrate how the energy equation may be applied to a specific system to examine the relative contributions corresponding to the terms in the equation. The examples show that lhe processes involved in cell heat generation may be complex and thai the application of a sufficiently general energy equation is advantageous.},

abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries have become the focus of research interest, thanks to their numerous benefits for vehicle applications. One main limitation of these technologies resides in the battery ageing. The effects of battery ageing limit its performance and occur throughout their whole life, whether the battery is used or not, which is a major drawback on real usage. Furthermore, degradations take place in every condition, but in different proportions as usage and external conditions interact to provoke degradations. The ageing phenomena are highly complicated to characterize due to the factors cross-dependence. This paper reviews various aspects of recent research and developments, from different fields, on lithium-ion battery ageing mechanisms and estimations. In this paper is presented a summary of techniques, models and algorithms used for battery ageing estimation (SOH, RUL), going from a detailed electrochemical approach to statistical methods based on data. In order to present the accuracy of currently used methods, their respective characteristics are discussed. Remaining challenges are deeply detailed, along with a discussion about the ideal method resulting from existing methods. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In recent years, lithium-ion batteries have often been proposed as part of various hybrid energy systems. Examples of such applications are hybrid vehicles, photovoltaic-battery or wind-battery systems and power distribution grids. One of the key functions of a battery is to be source of an additional power when the main power source in the system cannot cover the power demands. The power capability of the battery is described by its impedance characteristic. It depends significantly on the battery state-of-charge (SoC), the temperature, the current and the previous history. In this paper, these dependencies and their variations over the battery lifetime are investigated on a 40 Ah lithium-ion cell produced by Kokam (Type SLPB100216216H) with nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cathode material as an example. For this purpose, a full characterisation of the battery impedance is performed in the new and aged states using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the current-pulse technique. The results obtained for the new and aged states are compared. The results show, for example, that the SoC range, in which the battery operates with high efficiency, decreases due to significant aging. For the first time, the nonlinearity (current dependency) of the battery resistance is investigated extensively. It varies slightly with the SoC and considerably with the temperature, and it also changes during the battery lifetime. Furthermore, the dependency of the lithium-ion battery impedance on the short-time previous history is shown for the first time for a new and aged cell. The influence of the measured dependencies of the battery impedance on potential applications is discussed. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The literature has rarely explored such issues. This paper presents a battery pack system in a demonstrated EV with 96 cells in series and discovers the battery power fade fault during the demonstration. The preliminary analysis, after collecting data and preprocessing the typical data periods, shows that the internal or contact resistance increase causes the fault. To further identify the fault cause, we introduce an equivalent circuit model (ECM) and identify the cell resistances using the total least squares algorithm. A diagnostic method is proposed, using the identified cell resistances from 3 months demonstration data. Calculating the Shannon entropy clearly identifies the cause of the power fade fault. Appropriate measures are taken to solve the fault, and the latent safety issue is eliminated. The proposed diagnostic method can be used on-site for EV diagnosis without laboratory testing methods. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Lithium-ion battery packs for automotive applications consist of hundreds of cells, and depending on the pack architecture, individual cells may experience non-uniform thermal boundary conditions. This paper presents the first study of the impact of artificially induced thermal gradients on cell performance. The charge transfer resistance of a 4.8 Ah is verified to have a strong temperature dependence following the Arrhenius law. Thermal cycling of the cell, combined with slow rate cyclic voltammetry, allows to rapidly identify phase transitions in electrodes, due to the thermal effect of entropy changes. A cell with a temperature gradient maintained across is found to have a lower impedance than one held at the theoretical average temperature. This feature is attributed to details of the inner structure of the cell, and to the non-linear temperature dependence of the charge transfer resistance. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, similar modulation schemes have not yet been presented for the modular multilevel topology. In the proposed modulation method, the pulse pattern is chosen in such a way that the stored energy in each submodule remains stable. It is shown that this can be done at the fundamental switching frequency without measuring the capacitor voltages or using any other form of feedback control. Such a modulation scheme has not been presented before. The theoretical results are verified by both simulations and experimental results. The simulation results show successful operation at the fundamental switching frequency with a larger number of submodules. When a smaller number of submodules are used, harmonic elimination methods may be applied. This is verified experimentally on a converter with eight submodules per phase leg. The experimental results verify that stable operation can be maintained at the fundamental switching frequency while successfully eliminating the fifth harmonic in the ac-side voltage.},

The compressive mechanical properties of a microporous polypropylene separator are characterized over a range of strain rates and in different fluid environments. These measurements are then compared to measurements of the rate and fluid-dependent mechanical properties of the separator under tension. High strain rate dependence due to viscoelasticity is observed in both tension and compression. An additional rate dependence due to poroelastic effects is observed in compression at high strain rates. A reduction in mechanical properties is observed in DMC solvent environments for both tension and compression, but is found to be less pronounced in compression. The difference in mechanical properties between compression and tension highlight the anisotropic nature of battery separators and the importance of measuring compressive properties in addition to tensile properties.},

It may be that, like most materials, failure depends on local imperfections and inhomogeneities. In this work we use tomographic data previously obtained for a commercial lithium-ion battery graphite composite electrode to evaluate the homogeneity of the tortuosity of the electrode by directly integrating the transport equations through its pore space. We find that the tortuosity of two halves of the electrode, each roughly 250 x 350 x 50 mu m differ by about 30{\%}. On a smaller scale, 80 x 100 x 50 mu m, local tortuosity variations up to a factor of 3 were observed. The Bruggeman relationship between porosity and tortuosity is also examined. We find that local porosity alone does not determine local tortuosity very well, and that the average relationship between porosity and tortuosity is not well predicted by the Bruggeman relationship for this electrode. We suggest that large local variations in tortuosity can lead to reduced capacity and life. (C) 2011 The Electrochemical Society. [DOI: 10.1149/2.079112jes] All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Electrochemical Society. Overpotentials induced by liquid-phase composition variation can be important when electrochemical devices are operated at high current. The dominant models that describe such 'diffusion potentials' are Nernst-Planck (dilute-solution) theory and Onsager-Stefan-Maxwell (concentrated-solution) theory. Nernst-Planck flux laws emerge from Onsager-Stefan-Maxwell laws in the limit of high electrolyte dilution, and the material properties involved come into agreement. The two models yield different expressions for diffusion potentials in the dilute limit, however, because of a disparity in how electric potential is defined. As applied to lithiumion batteries, concentrated-solution theory employs a voltage measured by a reference electrode reversible to lithium cations; this provides an unambiguous connection to a measurement process, albeit hypothetical on a local scale. After the Nernst-Planck voltage is related to such a properly referenced voltage, the discrepancy in diffusion potentials vanishes. The impact of using Nernst-Planck voltages instead of measurable voltages is illustrated by simulations of a lithium-ion battery. Terminal-to-terminal voltage is relatively unaffected, but the thermal response and internal states change significantly.},

The exfoliation and thick deposition increased the ohmic resistance, film resistance, and charge transfer resistance of the cell and decreased the capacity significantly. Metallic lithium did not exist in either the upper or the lower deposition layer according to the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), the discharge curve, and anode potential. The outer region of both the lower and the upper deposition layers consisted of Li2CO3, LiOH, ROCO2Li, and ROLi. The inner region of the etched lower deposition layer mainly consisted of Li2O, LiF, and Li2CO3, and that of the etched upper deposition layer mainly consisted of Li2CO3, ROCO2Li, ROLi, and LiF. Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) film hindering the intercalation of lithium ions into carbon layers and LiCoO2 cathode providing lithium source for the deposition were the two reasons leading to the formation of lithium compound deposition during long-term cycles. Because SEI film on the lower surface of MCMB layer was thicker than that on the upper surface, lithium compound deposition generated on the lower surface first.},

abstract = {A physics-based Li-ion battery (LIB) aging model accounting for both lithium plating and solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) growth is presented, and is applied to study the aging behavior of a cell undergoing prolonged cycling at moderate operating conditions. Cell aging is found to be linear in the early stage of cycling but highly nonlinear in the end with rapid capacity drop and resistance rise. The linear aging stage is found to be dominated by SEI growth, while the transition from linear to nonlinear aging is attributed to the sharp rise of lithium plating rate. Lithium plating starts to occur in a narrow portion of the anode near the separator after a certain number of cycles. The onset of lithium plating is attributed to the drop of anode porosity associated with SEI growth, which aggravates the local electrolyte potential gradient in the anode. The presence of lithium metal accelerates the porosity reduction, further promoting lithium plating. This positive feedback leads to exponential increase of lithium plating rate in the late stage of cycling, as well as local pore clogging near the anode/separator interface which in turn leads to a sharp resistance rise.},

abstract = {Most of the stand-alone photovoltaic (PV) systems require an energy storage buffer to supply continuous energy to the load when there is inadequate solar irradiation. Typically, Valve Regulated Lead Acid (VRLA) batteries are utilized for this application. However, supplying a large burst of current, such as motor startup, from the battery degrades battery plates, resulting in destruction of the battery. An alterative way of supplying large bursts of current is to combine VRLA batteries and supercapacitors to form a hybrid storage system, where the battery can supply continuous energy and the supercapacitor can supply the instant power to the load. In this paper, the role of the supercapacitor in a PV energy control unit (ECU) is investigated by using Matlab/Simulink models. The ECU monitors and optimizes the power flow from the PV to the battery-supercapacitor hybrid and the load. Three different load conditions are studied, including a peak current load, pulsating current load and a constant current load. The simulation results show that the hybrid storage system can achieve higher specific power than the battery storage system.},

The work presented in this paper tries to minimize the stresses on battery, present during periods of acceleration and braking of PMDC traction motor by adding ultracapacitor in parallel as an auxiliary power source. Unidirectional and bidirectional DC-DC converters are used with battery and ultracapacitor respectively to ensure proper energy flow to (and from) motor during different stages of driving cycle. State space averaging technique is used to model the converters. The power management algorithm intelligently divides the current demanded by motor between battery and ultracapacitor current. The control strategy uses classical controllers, which are designed using bode plot based technique. The simulation is done on MATLAB/SIMULINK.},

abstract = {Lithium ion batteries are commonly employed in hybrid electric vehicles and achieving high energy density in the battery has been among the most critical issues in the automotive industry. Since thermal management is very important in the automotive batteries with layout limitation, a design strategy for effective cooling should be carefully opted. Particularly, a forced air cooling has been considered as a practical option in the automotive industry. In this article, a specific design of air-cooled battery system is theoretically investigated and numerically modelled to satisfy the required thermal specifications. Since a typical battery system in hybrid electric vehicles consists of the stacked multiple battery cells, cooling performance is determined mainly by the uniform distribution of air flow in the coolant passage which dissipates heat generated from the battery cells. It is demonstrated that the required cooling performance can be achieved by employing the tapered manifold and pressure relief ventilation even without changing the layout/design of the existing battery system. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis is performed as a design guideline to enhance the cooling performance. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In a sensor network, in practice, the communication among sensors is subject to: 1) errors that can cause failures of links among sensors at random times; 2) costs; and 3) constraints, such as power, data rate, or communication, since sensors and networks operate under scarce resources. The paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the probabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to maximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link communication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall communication budget constraint. We model the network as a Bernoulli random topology and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for mean square sense (mss) and almost sure (a.s.) convergence of average consensus when network links fail. In particular, a necessary and sufficient condition is for the algebraic connectivity of the mean graph topology to be strictly positive. With these results, we show that the topology design with random link failures, link communication costs, and a communication cost constraint is a constrained convex optimization problem that can be efficiently solved for large networks by semidefinite programming techniques. Simulations demonstrate that the optimal design improves significantly the convergence speed of the consensus algorithm and can achieve the performance of a non-random network at a fraction of the communication cost.},

This novel MMC design enables each MMC cell to operate autonomously, without central control, by sensing the local inductor voltage. Batteries are loaded with a current proportional to their capacity, and the MMC cells also work together to minimize the output ripple voltage of the full series stack. We show experimentally that the novel decentralized controller implemented in each MMC cell can reduce the output voltage ripple by 69{\%}.

abstract = {Volumetric expansion of silicon anode particles in a lithium-ion battery during charging may lead to the generation of undesirable internal stresses. For a cylindrical particle such growth may also lead to failure by buckling if the expansion is constrained in the axial direction due to other particles or supporting structures. To mitigate this problem, the possibility of reducing axial growth is investigated theoretically by studying simple modifications of the solid cylinder geometry. First, an annular cylinder is considered with lithiation either from the inside or from the outside. In both cases, the reduction of axial growth is not found to be significant. Next, explicit physical constraints are studied by addition of a non-growing elasto-plastic material: first, an outer annular constraint on a solid silicon cylinder, and second a rod-like inner constraint for an annular silicon cylinder. In both cases, it is found that axial growth can be reduced if the yield stress of the constraining material is significantly higher than that of silicon and/or the thickness of the constraint is relatively high. Phase diagrams are presented for both the outer and the inner constraint cases to identify desirable operating zones. Finally, to interpret the phase diagrams and isolate the key physical principles two different simplified models are presented and are shown to recover important qualitative trends of the numerical simulation results.},

abstract = {This paper presents an investigation on the unbalanced discharging and aging due to temperature difference between the parallel-connected cells. A thermal-electrochemical model is developed for the parallel-connected battery pack. The effects of temperature difference on the unbalanced discharging performances are studied by simulations and experiments. For the parallel-connected cells, the cell at higher temperature experiences a larger current in the early discharging process before approximately 75{\%} of depth of discharge (DOD). When the discharge process approaches the voltage turn point of the battery pack, the discharge current through the cell at higher temperature begins to decrease significantly. After the DOD reaches approximately 90{\%}, the discharge current of the cell at higher temperature rises again. Correspondingly, the changes in the discharging current through the cell at lower temperature are opposite to that of the cell at higher temperature. Simulations also show that the temperature difference between the parallel-connected cells greatly aggravates the imbalance discharge phenomenon between the cells, which accelerates the losses of the battery pack capacity. For the parallel-connected battery pack, the capacity loss rate approximately increases linearly as the temperature difference between the cells increases. This trend is magnified with the increase of operating temperature.},

abstract = {Understanding and improving Li transport through crystalline Li2CO3, a stable component of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) films in Li-ion batteries, is critical to battery rate performance, capacity drop, and power loss. Identification of the dominant diffusion carriers and their diffusion pathways in SEI films coated on anode and cathode surfaces is a necessary step toward the development of methods to increase Li conductivity. In this paper, we identify the dominant Li diffusion carriers in Li2CO3 over a voltage range (0–4.4 V) that includes typical anode and cathode materials by computing and comparing thermodynamics of all seven Li-associated point defects with density functional theory (DFT). The main diffusion carriers in Li2CO3 below 0.98 V are excess Li-ion interstitials; however, above 3.98 V, Li-ion vacancies become the dominant diffusion carrier type, and they have the same concentration in the voltage range of 0.98–3.98 V.

abstract = {Two types of ultracapacitor modules have been developed for use as energy-storage devices for 42-V systems in automobiles. The modules show high performance and good reliability in terms of discharge and recharge capability, long-term endurance, and high energy and power. During a 42-V system simulation test of 6-kW power boosting/regenerative braking, the modules demonstrate very good performance. In high-power applications such as 42-V and hybrid vehicle systems, ultracapacitors have many merits compared with batteries, especially with respect to specific power at high rate, thermal stability, charge-discharge efficiency, and cycle-life. Ultracapacitors are also very safe, reliable and environmentally friendly. The cost of ultracapacitors is still high compared with batteries because of the low production scale, but is decreasing very rapidly. It is estimated that the cost of ultracapacitors will decrease to US{\$} 300 per 42-V module in the near future. Also, the maintenance cost of the ultracapacitor is nearly zero because of its high cycle-life. Therefore, the combined cost of the capacitor and maintenance will be lower than that of batteries in the near future. Overall, comparing performance, price and other parameters of ultracapacitors with batteries, ultracapacitors are the most likely candidate for energy-storage in 42-V systems. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Droop control is the basic control method for load current sharing in dc microgrid applications. The conventional dc droop control method is realized by linearly reducing the dc output voltage as the output current increases. This method has two limitations. First, with the consideration of line resistance in a droop-controlled dc microgrid, since the output voltage of each converter cannot be exactly the same, the output current sharing accuracy is degraded. Second, the DC bus voltage deviation increases with the load due to the droop action. In this paper, in order to improve the performance of the dc microgrid operation, a low bandwidth communication (LBC) based improved droop control method is proposed. In contrast with the conventional approach, the control system does not require a centralized secondary controller. Instead, it uses local controllers and the LBC network to exchange information between converter units. The droop controller is employed to achieve independent operation and average voltage and current controllers are used in each converter to simultaneously enhance the current sharing accuracy and restore the dc bus voltage. All of the controllers are realized locally, and the LBC system is only used for changing the values of the dc voltage and current. Hence, a decentralized control scheme is accomplished. The simulation test based on Matlab/Simulink and the experimental validation based on a 2×2.2 kW prototype were implemented to demonstrate the proposed approach.},

accomplished through the timely insertion of state-of-the-art battery

will be demonstrated by means of system prototypes for proof of concept.
A Stationary Battery Charger/Analyzer (SBCA) unit was developed for the
program, The SBCA possesses charge, discharge and analysis capability
for up to five batteries at a given time. The SBCA uses algorithms that
are stored in a battery database. This database will contain pertinent
battery data, such as capacity, charge cycles, failures and logistical
information on each battery within the local system. The SBCA is able to
communicate with a Portable Battery Charger for uploading these same
algorithms and downloading data for batteries located at remote sites.
The program was designed to address three battery chemistries: lead
acid, nickel-cadmium and silver-zinc. However, the SBCA will be capable
of charging and testing any rechargeable battery that has similar
current profiles and termination criteria. Finally, the expected
benefits of implementing this solution throughout the fleet will be
discussed. Projected cost savings due to use of this new technology will
be quantified and presented in this paper},

The batteries cycled 500 times at 0.5 C were found to lose 13{\%} of their original capacity, which was solely due to the loss of active materials. The negative electrode maintained its capacity to contain Li+ ions from the positive electrode. The loss of positive electrode materials was attributed to formation and thickening of the surface layer and structure disorder evidenced by XRD measurements. In situ impedance measurements revealed that the positive electrode was also responsible for the impedance rise upon cycling. The charge transfer resistance was found to be the most influential factor in the battery impedance, which increased exponentially during cycling. This increase was proved not due to the decrease of positive electrode surface area but resulted from growth of the surface layer. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = { The stator winding temperature of an induction machine is estimated from either a thermal model-based or an induction machine parameter-based temperature estimator. The thermal model-based temperature estimator is simple and robust, but it is usually incapable of giving an accurate temperature estimate tailored to a specific motor's thermal capacity. The induction machine parameter-based temperature estimator is accurate and machine-dependent, but it is often too sensitive to the machine's parametric changes. For small to medium size mains-fed induction machines with TEFC design, a hybrid thermal model is proposed to unify these two temperature estimators. Based on this hybrid thermal model, an adaptive Kalman filter is then formulated to track the stator winding temperature with increased accuracy and robustness. Noise identification and input estimation techniques are used in the Kalman filter to obtain an optimal estimate of the stator winding temperature. The experimental results are given to validate the proposed scheme. The overall algorithm provides efficient and accurate tracking of the stator winding temperature, ensures safe and reliable motor operation and avoids nuisance overload trips, all without using any real temperature sensors.},

Sandia National Laboratories has a broad-based program that includes analysis, engineering and model development. We have determined thermal properties of lithium batteries using a variety of calorimetric methods for many years. We developed the capability to model temperature gradients and cooling rates of high-temperature primary lithium thermal batteries several years ago. Work is now under way to characterize the response of ambient-temperature rechargeable lithium-ion batteries to thermal abuse. Once the self-heating rates of lithium cells have been established over a range of temperatures, the thermal response can be estimated under a variety of conditions. We have extended this process to isolate the behavior of individual battery components and have begun to understand the chemical nature of the species responsible for heat evolution within the cells. This enhanced level of understanding will enable more accurate modeling of cell thermal behavior and will allow model-based design of safer, more abuse-tolerant lithium batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) in the future.

Among various methods, a.c. impedance spectroscopy over a wide range of frequencies provides a variety of parameters which are functions of the SoC of a given battery. These parameters and their variation with SoC depend on the type of battery and on the experimental conditions. The impedance data of sealed commercial cells are rather tedious to analyze since the results are generally the combined parameters of both the positive and the negative electrodes. Separation of the parameters which correspond to the individual electrodes involves assumptions, the validity of which is open to question. Nevertheless, systematic linear and reproducible variations of measurable or computable impedance parameters with battery condition are useful indicators of the SoC in a non-destructive way. The present review consolidates the literature on the prediction of the SoC of batteries by means of a.c. impedance measurements.},

Volume averaging PDEs yield ODEs. Hence volume averaging is the basic method used for model reduction. The gradient or profile information lost on volume averaging is recovered through profile based approximations. For the lowest order reduced order model (ROM), a uniform reaction rate, quadratic electrolyte concentrations and quartic solid phase concentrations are assumed. In this ROM only 5 linear ODEs are solved, and the rest are nonlinear algebraic evaluations. When compared with the detailed electrochemical model of a lithium ion cell, this ROM gives negligible error at nominal currents and a maximum error of about 3{\%} at high currents, for a typical commercial cell. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.

Since the switching functions have a periodical nature, the steady state of the system is calculated. Using the (LTV) model, both balanced and imbalanced operations of the converter are analyzed. Since the calculation of the steady state requires a low computational effort, the proposed method showed a good alternative to the numerical iterative procedures. Applying the LTV method to the modular multilevel converter, the different operating points are determined depending from the converter parameters. Special attention was paid on finding the optimal operating point concerning the module current. Since the presence of the second harmonic of the converter's arm current and its dependence from the converter parameters is determined, it is used to optimize the module conditions.

abstract = {Lithium batteries are characterized by high specific energy, high efficiency and long life. These unique properties have made lithium batteries the power sources of choice for the consumer electronics market with a production of the order of billions of units per year. These batteries are also expected to find a prominent role as ideal electrochemical storage systems in renewable energy plants, as well as power systems for sustainable vehicles, such as hybrid and electric vehicles. However, scaling up the lithium battery technology for these applications is still problematic since issues such as safety, costs, wide operational temperature and materials availability, are still to be resolved. This review focuses first on the present status of lithium battery technology, then on its near future development and finally it examines important new directions aimed at achieving quantum jumps in energy and power content. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Battery technology plays an important role in energy storage. In particular, lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries are of great interest, because of their high capacity, long cycle life, and high energy and power density. However, for further improvements of Li-ion batteries, a deeper understanding of physical processes occurring within this type of battery, including transport, is needed. To provide a detailed description of these phenomena, a 3D representation is required for the morphology of composite materials used in Li-ion batteries. In this paper, we develop a stochastic simulation model in 3D, which is based on random marked point processes, to reconstruct real and generate virtual morphologies. For this purpose, a statistical technique to fit the model to 3D image data gained by X-ray tomography is developed. Finally, we validate the model by comparing real and simulated data using image characteristics which are especially relevant with respect to transport properties. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier B.V.

The results indicate that the switching loss and energy transfer efficiency can be substantially improved using the quasi-resonant ZCS (QRZCS) technology in a battery charging system with an individual cell equalizer (ICE). The validity of the battery equalization is further verified using an experimental installation involving a battery string of three lithium-ion cells.

The samples were prepared by a melt-solidifying technique. Since the crystals grew essentially along the (002) plane of the monoclinic Li2CO3structure, the conductivity, $\sigma$,was measured by impedance spectrometry both along and perpendicular to (002) using gold paste as electrodes. By the Tubandt method, Li2CO3was a pure lithium ion conductor. The conduction along (002) was much larger than that perpendicular to (002). The conductivity of Li2CO3was similar in magnitude to that of Li4SiO4, Li5AlO4and Li2SO4. The conductivity increased proportionally with the Li3PO4concentration, and decreased with an increase in LiNO3and CaCO3concentration. It was concluded that the conduction in Li2CO3is essentially by interstitial lithium ions. The Frenkel constant and the mobility of lithium interstitial ions were calculated. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Fuel efficiency gains of approximately 5{\%} were achieved by passive hybridisation in addition to addressing two main operational degradation mechanisms: no-load idling and rapid load cycling. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy measurements indicated that the supercapacitor capacitance dropped with decreasing cell voltage and suggested that operation below 1.3 V is not recommended. Knee-frequency measurements suggested little benefit was gained in using passive systems with load cycles that have frequency components above 0.19 Hz.

abstract = {Energy storage systems (ESS) are becoming one of the most important components that noticeably change overall system performance in various applications, ranging from the power grid infrastructure to electric vehicles (EV) and portable electronics. However, a homogeneous ESS is subject to limited characteristics in terms of cost, efficiency, lifetime, etc., by the energy storage technology that comprises the ESS. On the other hand, hybrid ESS (HESS) are a viable solution for a practical ESS with currently available technologies as they have potential to overcome such limitations by exploiting only advantages of heterogeneous energy storage technologies while hiding their drawbacks. However, the HESS concept basically mandates sophisticated design and control to actually make the benefits happen. The HESS architecture should be able to provide controllability of many parts, which are often fixed in homogeneous ESS, and novel management policies should be able to utilize the control features. This paper introduces a complete design practice of a HESS prototype to demonstrate scalability, flexibility, and energy efficiency. It is composed of three heterogenous energy storage elements: lead-acid batteries, lithium-ion batteries, and supercapacitors. We demonstrate a novel system control methodology and enhanced energy efficiency through this design practice.{\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It requires only the voltage and current waveforms during switching and calculates the power loss and also provides the frequency content during switching. The information regarding frequency content can be utilized for designing snubber as well as for EMI analysis. Multi Resolution Analysis (MRA) is used to decompose signals in wavelet domain and the signals are transformed in different frequency bands.

In fact, it has been shown that the modular multilevel converter can even be operated at the fundamental switching frequency. If the circulating current is not controlled, a second-order harmonic component will appear. This component increases the resistive losses and the capacitor voltage ripple. Different control methods have been developed for eliminating this component in the circulating current. These are, however, based on continuous representations of the system and no control method suitable for fundamental switching frequency have yet been proposed. This paper presents a control method that combines a fundamental switching frequency scheme with an active control of the circulating current. The controller is verified experimentally on a 10-kVA laboratory prototype with five submodules per arm. The experimental validation is performed in both inverter and rectifier modes.},

abstract = {The robustness of consensus in single integrator multi-agent systems (MAS) to coupling delays and switching topologies is investigated. It is shown that consensus is reached for arbitrarily large constant, time-varying, or distributed delays if consensus is reached without delays. This delay robustness holds under the weakest possible connectivity assumptions on the underlying graph, i.e., as long as the graph is uniformly quasi-strongly connected and switches with a dwell-time. The proof is based on a contraction argument and allows to remove technical assumptions that were used in previous publications. Moreover, the result also applies to non-scalar single integrators, an important extension toward consensus and rendezvous in higher dimensions. View full abstract},

abstract = {Battery packs of multi-batteries supply high voltage when batteries are connected in series and high capacity when connected in parallel, which provides a new substitution of power supply for portable electronic device. A simulation method is, therefore, proposed to simulate the discharge behaviors of battery system with parallel and/or series connection. Using the simulation proposed, voltage, discharging capacity and residual capacity of the pack and individual battery at every time unit may be calculated at a given discharge current. When one of the batteries in the series-connection has a distinctly lower capacity, this battery reaches its fully discharged state sooner than the others during discharge. The simulated current distribution of a battery pack of two different-capacity batteries in parallel shows that although the pack is discharged at constant current, current through each battery is neither a constant nor proportional to its capacity. A battery of higher capacity carries a larger current. A pronounced change in current is observed near the end of the discharge process where voltage is near the cut-off value. We believe the proposed simulation method may be extended to a battery pack of multiple batteries of any capacity in any number and connections. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The battery management system (BMS) of a battery-electric road vehicle must ensure an optimal operation of the electrochemical storage system to guarantee for durability and reliability. In particular, the BMS must provide precise information about the battery's state-of-functionality, i.e. how much dis-/charging power can the battery accept at current state and condition while at the same time preventing it from operating outside its safe operating area. These critical limits have to be calculated in a predictive manner, which serve as a significant input factor for the supervising vehicle energy management (VEM). The VEM must provide enough power to the vehicle's drivetrain for certain tasks and especially in critical driving situations. Therefore, this paper describes a new approach which can be used for state-of-available-power estimation with respect to lowest/highest cell voltage prediction using an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The estimated voltage for a given time frame in the future is directly compared with the actual voltage, verifying the effectiveness and accuracy of a relative voltage prediction error of less than 1{\%}. Moreover, the real-time operating capability of the proposed algorithm was verified on a battery test bench while running on a real-time system performing voltage prediction. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Jiang2011a,
abstract = {Good battery modeling is critical for energy management of electric vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles. Because of its simplicity and satisfactory performance, equivalent circuit models are widely used in this area. A frequently adopted equivalent circuit model is one that consists of an open-circuit voltage and a resistor in series with two sets of parallel resistor-capacitor combinations. This model performs well in describing battery transient behavior due to the dynamics of such physical phenomena as mass transport effects and double layer effects. Generic methods for obtaining the parameters of this model involve analyzing the battery voltage behavior under step changes of load current. The fact that the model has two time constants places a challenge on parameter identification. Some most often used method makes use of the property that each of the two time constants plays a dominant role at different stages of the battery voltage response, and calculates the model parameters accordingly. For such method, the results are greatly influenced by the partition of faster and slower dynamics of the battery, and selection of the data points used for the calculation. Moreover, because majority of the testing data is not used towards calculating the parameters, the obtained model might not reflect the overall battery characteristics well and consequently might not give high-fidelity predictions. For other methods that use nonlinear curve fitting or genetic algorithm for parameter searching, the successful implementation greatly depends on the proper setting of initial values and searching space. A novel method of parameter identification for the equivalent circuit model is presented in this paper. It makes use of a regression equation which is linear in variables that can be measured or calculated from the test. With this approach, all testing data during the relaxation period of a constant current pulse discharge or charge test is used towards obtaining the model parameters and the calculation is in the sense of least squared error. Application of the method to real battery testing data is presented. The example indicates that the method gives very good results with modeling error of less than 0.5{\%}.},

abstract = {Through use of the local state isomorphism theorem instead of the algebraic equivalence theorem of linear systems theory, the similarity transformation approach is extended to nonlinear models, resulting in finitely verifiable sufficient and necessary conditions for global and local identifiability. The approach requires testing of certain controllability and observability conditions, but in many practical examples these conditions prove very easy to verify. In principle the method also involves nonlinear state variable transformations, but in all of the examples presented in the paper the transformations turn out to be linear. The method is applied to an unidentifiable nonlinear model and a locally identifiable nonlinear model, and these are the first nonlinear models other than bilinear models where the reason for lack of global identifiability is nontrivial. The method is also applied to two models with Michaelis-Menten elimination kinetics, both of considerable importance in pharmacokinetics, and for both of which the complicated nature of the algebraic equations arising from the Taylor series approach has hitherto defeated attempts to establish identifiability results for specific input functions.},

Conducted heat leakage through the calorimeter walls is estimated accurately by developing a simple thermal model and compared with the experimental results. Accuracy and reliability is investigated by performing experimental tests using a known heater. Limits for the air flow rate and temperature rise inside and across calorimeter chambers are derived, The calorimeter is capable of measuring a heat loss up to 1 kW corresponding to the 7.5 kW machine with an overall accuracy of ±15 W.

Numerically, a two dimensional CFD (computational fluid dynamics) model has been developed to perform detailed simulations of the thermal management issues within a battery pack cooled by air. Experimentally, systematic tests were performed to provide datasets to validate the CFD model. The main components in the experimental facility included a multi-cell battery pack and a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel facility generated well-controlled cooling air flow with velocity up to 30 m s -1 (???67 miles per hour). So that the study can be performed under flow conditions directly relevant to practice. The major contributions from this combined numerical-experimental study are threefold. First, the CFD model has been shown to capture the dynamics of the cooling of battery modules consisting of multiple battery cells, including temperature non-uniformity among cells. Second, the CFD simulations have been compared directly against experimental data to quantify the accuracy and validity of the CFD models. Third, based on the validated CFD models, a reduced-order model is developed to predict the maximum cell temperature in the battery module. The accuracy and simplicity of the reduced-order model makes it promising for in situ monitoring and control purposes. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In fact, CV step is responsible in a major part of lithium intercalation into negative electrode and revealed to give signification on cyclable lithium loss which is the major cause of calendar aging according to literature and post mortem analysis. Comparison from the aging of four battery technologies is presented. Through aging, results show a difference in battery behavior even if the time for CC charge is decreasing for all the battery. According to battery technology, the current during CV charge phase has been useful for lithium–nickel–manganese–cobalt-oxide, lithium–nickel–cobalt–aluminum-oxide and lithium-ion–manganese battery state-of-health determination.

abstract = {The entropy changes (??S) in various cathode and anode materials, as well as complete Li-ion batteries, were measured using an electrochemical thermodynamic measurement system (ETMS). A thermal model based on the fundamental properties of individual electrodes was used to obtain transient and equilibrium temperature distributions of Li-ion batteries. The results from theoretical simulations were compared with results obtained in experimental measurements. We found that the detailed shape of the entropy curves strongly depends on the manufacturer of the materials even for the same nominal compositions. LiCoO2 has a much larger entropy change than LiNixCoyMnzO2. This means that LiNixCoyMnzO2 is much more thermodynamically stable than LiCoO2). The temperatures around the positive terminal of a prismatic battery are consistently higher than those at the negative terminal, due to differences in the thermal conductivities of the different terminal connectors. When all other simulation parameters are the same, simulations that use a battery-averaged entropy tend to overestimate the predicted temperatures when compared with simulations that use individual entropies for the anode and the cathode, due to computational averaging. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

If electron mobility is low, the rate of film growth is limited by transport of electrons through the film, and the rate decreases as the thickness increases.

The temperature dependence of the solid phase diffusion coefficient of the lithium in the intercalation particles, the electrochemical reaction rate constants, and the open circuit potentials (OCPs) of the positive and negative electrodes are included in the model. The solution phase polarization is approximated using a nonlinear resistance, which is a function of current and temperature. The model is used to predict the temperature and voltage profiles in a lithium-ion cell during galvanostatic operations. The single-particle thermal model is validated by comparing the simulated voltage and temperature profiles to the results obtained using a distributed porous electrode model. The simulation results from the single-particle thermal model also show good agreement with experimental voltage data obtained from lithium-ion pouch cells under different discharge rates (C/33, C/2 and C) at different temperatures (15, 25, 35, and 45C).},

abstract = {Lithium-ion battery systems employed in high power demanding systems such as electric vehicles require a sophisticated monitoring system to ensure safe and reliable operation. Three major states of the battery are of special interest and need to be constantly monitored, these include: battery state of charge (SoC), battery state of health (capcity fade determination, SoH), and state of function (power fade determination, SoF). In a series of two papers, we propose a system of algorithms based on a weighted recursive least quadratic squares parameter estimator, that is able to determine the battery impedance and diffusion parameters for accurate state estimation. The functionality was proven on different battery chemistries with different aging conditions. The first paper investigates the general requirements on BMS for HEV/EV applications. In parallel, the commonly used methods for battery monitoring are reviewed to elaborate their strength and weaknesses in terms of the identified requirements for on-line applications. Special emphasis will be placed on real-time capability and memory optimized code for cost-sensitive industrial or automotive applications in which low-cost microcontrollers must be used. Therefore, a battery model is presented which includes the influence of the Butler-Volmer kinetics on the charge-transfer process. Lastly, the mass transport process inside the battery is modeled in a novel state-space representation. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The most widely used energy storage technology is the battery, which stores energy in an electrochemical form. There is a need for highly efficient and long life battery systems for spacecrafts at various power levels. Li-ion based battery technology has better performance over traditional battery technologies. The battery system comprises of protection, management and balancing. Of these, balancing is most important that ensures the better performance and life of the battery system. A novel energy converter based active/non dissipative cell equalization method is implemented. This method comprises of digitally controlled resonant reset forward converter for individual Li-ion cells connected in series. This converter is used to transfer the energy from the higher voltage cell to the lower voltage cell. The main objective is to maintain cells in a battery at the same state of charge (SOC), and the voltage. The most innovative and attractive aspects of the system are efficient converter, filter and the discrete digital controller. This paper mainly concentrates on various control techniques that can be implemented to achieve effective cell balancing and to compensate the temperature, component aging and radiation effects for space applications.

Researchers have been focusing on developing new and renewable energy resources to meet the increasing fuel demand and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A surge of research effort is also being directed towards replacing fossil fuel based vehicles with hybrid and electric alternatives. Energy storage is now seen as a critical element in future ``smart grid and elec- tric vehicle'' applications. Electrochemical energy storage systems offer the best combination of efficiency, cost and flexibility, with redox flow battery systems currently leading the way in this aspect. In this work, a panoramic overview is presented for the various redox flow battery systems and their hybrid alternatives. Relevant published work is reported and critically discussed. A comprehensive study of the available technologies is conducted in terms of technical aspects as well as economic and environmen- tal consequences. Some of the flow battery limitations and technical challenges are also discussed and a range of further research opportunities are presented. Of the flow battery technologies that have been investigated, the all-vanadium redox flow battery has received the most attention and has shown most promise in various pre-commercial to commercial stationary applications to date, while new developments in hybrid redox fuel cells are promising to lead the way for future applications in mechanically and elec- trically ``refuelable'' electric vehicles.},

The current shared between the battery and the electrochemical capacitor at very short times depends on the ohmic resistances of the battery and the capacitor. As the discharge proceeds, the operating conditions such as frequency, duty ratio, and peak pulse discharge current control the current shared among parallel circuits. These parameters also determine the extent of the run time increase of the hybrid system as compared to the battery system.

In the present work, a model order reduction of the complete electrochemical model for a lithium ion cell with phase change electrodes is carried out. The phase change phenomenon is described using a simple, concentration-dependent diffusivity derived from mixture rules. This reduced order model (ROM) is validated with experimental data from literature. The applicability of the model to capture the atypical behavior of the phase change electrode system is demonstrated. Using the cell response from ROM, charge-discharge asymmetry and path dependence in a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cell are explored in detail. In addition, side reaction kinetics and solid electrolyte interphase formation are included in the ROM framework to enhance its capability to predict cell aging. The model is used to investigate capacity losses occurring in a phase change electrode cell. Insights from these results are used to suggest cell operating guidelines for maximizing utilization. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {An in-depth historical and current review is presented on the science of lithium-ion battery (LIB) solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on the graphite anode, including structure, morphology, composition, electrochemistry, and formation mechanism. During initial LIB operation, the SEI layer forms on the graphite surfaces, the most common anode material. The SEI is essential to the long-term performance of LIBs, and it also has an impact on its initial capacity loss, self-discharge characteristics, rate capability, and safety. While the presence of the anode SEI is vital, it is difficult to control its formation and growth, as they depend on several factors. These factors include the type of graphite, electrolyte composition, electrochemical conditions, and temperature. Thus, SEI formation and electrochemical stability over long-term operation should be a primary topic of future investigation in the LIB development. This article covers the progression of knowledge regarding the SEI, from its discovery in 1979 to the current state of understanding, and covers differences in the chemical and structural makeup when cell materials and components are varied. It also discusses the relationship of the SEI layer to the LIB formation step, involving both electrolyte wetting and subsequent slow charge-discharge cycles to grow the SEI.},

abstract = {Conventional battery management systems (BMSs) for electric vehicles (EVs) are designed in an ad hoc way, causing the supply of EVs to fall behind the market demand. A well-designed and combined hardware-software architecture is essential for the efficient management of a large-scale battery pack that may consists of thousands of battery cells as in Tesla Motors and GM Chevy Volt. We propose a Dependable, Efficient, Scalable Architecture (DESA) that effectively monitors a large number of battery cells, efficiently controls, and reconfigures, if needed, their connection arrangement. DESA supports hierarchical, autonomous management of battery cells, where a global BMS orchestrates a group of local BMSs. A local controller on each local BMS autonomously manages an array of battery cells, and the global controller reconfigures the connectivity of such battery-cell arrays in coordination with the local controllers. Also, DESA allows individual arrays and local BMSs to be selectively powered-off for energy savings. The performance of this energy-saving capability is modeled and evaluated using a Markov chain. Our evaluation results show that DESA effectively tolerates battery-cell failures by an order-of-magnitude-while achieving 7.4× service cost savings-better than a conventional BMS. This superior performance not only extends the battery life significantly, but also provides the flexibility in supporting diverse electric power demands from a growing number of on-board applications. {\textcopyright}2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The stress field in a lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery can have a significant impact on its performance. To better understand the stress distribution in a Li-ion battery cell, a 2D multiphysics microstructural resolved model (MRM) with realistic electrode geometries has been developed. This model considers the species transport, battery kinetics, and the deformations and stresses of the components caused by Li intercalation. The model was used to examine a LixC6|PP|LiyMn2O4 cell. The stress distributions and developments in the active particles and in the binder were discussed in detail. The results show that while the intercalation stress distributions in general agree with the description of the analytical solutions for spherical active particles, a higher tangential stress can arise at the particle surface at locations where the local curvature is concave or when the particle is next to a rigid current collector. The results also indicate that between the two binder systems investigated, the one with a lower modulus and larger elongation appears to be a better choice over the higher modulus, less ductile grade, provided that the two systems have the same ratio of the interfacial adhesion strength to the binder strength. This work demonstrates the potential of the MRM in improving our understanding on the stress and deformation in battery components and in the selection of battery materials.},

abstract = {The impedance behavior of silicon nanowire electrodes has been investigated to understand the electrochemical process kinetics that influences the performance when used as a high-capacity anode in a lithium ion battery. The ac response was measured by using impedance spectroscopy in equilibrium conditions at different lithium compositions and during several cycles of charge and discharge in a half cell vs. metallic lithium. The impedance analysis shows the contribution of both surface resistance and solid state diffusion through the bulk of the nanowires. The surface process is dominated by a solid electrolyte layer (SEI) consisting of an inner, inorganic insoluble part and several organic compounds at the outer interface, as seen by XPS analysis. The surface resistivity, which seems to be correlated with the Coulombic efficiency of the electrode, grows at very high lithium contents due to an increase in the inorganic SEI thickness. We estimate the diffusion coefficient of about 2 × 10-10 cm2/s for lithium diffusion in silicon. A large increase in the electrode impedance was observed at very low lithium compositions, probably due to a different mechanism for lithium diffusion inside the wires. Restricting the discharge voltage to 0.7 V prevents this large impedance and improves the electrode lifetime. Cells cycled between 0.07 and 0.70 V vs. metallic lithium at a current density of 0.84 A/g (C/5) showed good Coulombic efficiency (about 99{\%}) and maintained a capacity of about 2000 mAh/g after 80 cycles.},

abstract = {Battery lifetime and safety are primary concerns in the design of battery operated systems. Lifetime management is typically supervised by the system via battery-aware task scheduling, while safety is managed on the battery side via features deployed into smart batteries. This research proposes IntellBatt; an intelligent battery cell array based novel design of a multi-cell battery that offloads battery lifetime management onto the battery. By deploying a battery cell array management unit, IntellBatt exploits various battery related characteristics such as charge recovery effect, to enhance battery lifetime and ensure safe operation. This is achieved by using real-time cell status information to selects cells to deliver the required load current, without the involvement of a complex task scheduler on the host system. The proposed design was evaluated via simulation using accurate cell models and real experimental traces from a portable DVD player. The use of a multi-cell design enhanced battery lifetime by 22{\%} in terms of battery discharge time. Besides a standalone deployment, IntellBatt can also be combined with existing battery-aware task scheduling approaches to further enhance battery lifetime.},

abstract = {This work discusses a two-step procedure, based on formal abstractions, to generate a finite-space stochastic dynamical model as an aggregation of the continuous temperature dynamics of a homogeneous population of Thermostatically Controlled Loads (TCL). The temperature of a single TCL is described by a stochastic difference equation and the TCL status (ON, OFF) by a deterministic switching mechanism. The procedure is formal as it allows the exact quantification of the error introduced by the abstraction -- as such it builds and improves on a known, earlier approximation technique in the literature. Further, the contribution discusses the extension to the case of a heterogeneous population of TCL by means of two approaches resulting in the notion of approximate abstractions. It moreover investigates the problem of global (population-level) regulation and load balancing for the case of TCL that are dependent on a control input. The procedure is tested on a case study and benchmarked against the mentioned alternative approach in the literature.},

Due to manufacturing variations, temperature differences, and aging, the individual cells perform differently. When a complete pack is charged and discharged as a single two-terminal circuit element, some cells are chronically overcharged, undercharged, or overdischarged, all of which act to reduce cell life. The performance and life of the complete pack is limited by the weakest cell. Many methods have been proposed and explored to mitigate this problem. In the present work, a switched-capacitor converter is shown to be a simple and effective method to maintain equal cell or monoblock charge conditions. Design criteria are discussed.},

This paper presents a spatial-resolution, lumped-capacitance (LC) thermal model for cylindrical battery cells under high Biot number (Bi. ???. 1) conditions where the classical LC thermal model is generally inapplicable because of a significant temperature variation in the cell volume. The spatial-resolution LC model was formulated using zero- and first-order Hermite integral approximations. For model validation, a one-dimensional, transient analytical (exact) solution using Green functions was obtained for a cylindrical Li-ion battery cell with uniform volumetric battery heat generation of Joule and entropic heating under convective cooling boundary conditions. It was found from the comparison of the results that the spatial-resolution LC thermal model can accurately and quickly predicts the cell temperatures (core, skin and area-averaged) under various dynamic battery duty cycles even for high Biot numbers due to highly convective conditions such as liquid cooling. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

In this model, the joint effect on the battery capacity degradation of any 2 out of 5 stress factors, which include ambient temperature, end of discharge and charge voltage (EODV and EOCV), and discharge and charge rate, is studied through coupling validation tests. Coupling generally exists among these 5 stress factors, and the coupling intensity has a certain relationship with the stress levels. There is a critical stress level at which the coupling can be considered negligible, and when the stress level goes higher, coupling aggravates battery degradation exponentially. Additionally, the study also indicates that battery life shows stronger sensitivity to discharge rate and EOCV than to charge rate and EODV. The developed capacity degradation model based on the input of real operating conditions and coupling intensity calibration achieves error less than 15{\%} when the cycling goes into the stable decay period, and the error converges gradually as the cycling continues. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper describes an advanced battery pack modeling method for automotive applications. In contrast to the common approach of aggregating hundreds of battery cell models in series and parallel for battery pack representation, a simple yet accurate electrical analogue battery model with constant parameters is used to represent the whole battery pack. The modeling process involves only the external characteristics of the battery pack, thus detailed knowledge of the physical construction of the battery pack or the physical parameters of the battery cells are avoided. Battery experimental tests include an independent pulse charging/discharging cycle test and several performance estimates acquired from the anticipated battery application. This modeling approach is achieved by anticipating the bandwidth of the battery application and then optimizing the bandwidth of the battery pack model with this knowledge. The reported work enables a fast dynamic battery pack simulation with a new level of high fidelity. Although the scope of this work does not include temperature and lifetime effects, it is shown that the form of the model and the parameter extraction procedure can encompass these important improvements.

In calendar aging tests three temperatures and various SOC are applied to the batteries. For cycle aging tests especially different cycle depths and mean SOC are taken into account. Capacity loss and resistance increase are monitored as functions of time and charge throughput during the tests. From these data physical based functions are obtained, giving a mathematical description of aging. To calculate the stress factors like temperature or voltage, an impedance based electric-thermal model is coupled to the aging model. The model accepts power and current profiles as input, furthermore an ambient air temperature profile can be applied. Various drive cycles and battery management strategies can be tested and optimized using the lifetime prognosis of this tool.

abstract = {The profitability of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) is significantly influenced by battery aging and electricity costs. Therefore a simulation model for PHEVs in the distribution grid is presented which allows to compare the influence of different charging strategies on these costs. The simulation is based on real-world driving behavior and European Energy Exchange (EEX) intraday prices for obtaining representative results. The analysis of comprehensive lithium-ion battery aging tests performed within this study shows that especially high battery states of charge (SOCs) decrease battery lifetime, whereas the cycling of batteries at medium SOCs only has a minor contribution to aging. Charging strategies that take into account the previously mentioned effects are introduced, and the SOC distributions and cycle loads of the vehicle battery are investigated. It can be shown that appropriate charging strategies significantly increase battery lifetime and reduce charging costs at the same time. Possible savings due to lifetime extension of the vehicle battery are approximately two times higher than revenues due to energy trading. The findings of this work indicate that car manufacturers and energy/mobility providers have to make efforts for developing intelligent charging strategies to reduce mobility costs and thus foster the introduction of electric mobility. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The temperature of battery modules in electric vehicles (EVs) must be controlled adequately to remain within a specified range for optimum performance. In this paper, thermal management of battery modules with phase change materials (PCMs) is investigated experimentally. An electric heater is used to simulate the heat source of a battery cell. Two different PCM designs are investigated: one with a PCM cylinder surrounding the heater, and the other with PCM jackets wrapping the heater. Both configurations exhibit good effectiveness in maintaining the heater within a desired temperature range. This paper also examines the effectiveness of PCM thermal management under variable heating rates and variable ambient temperatures, as well as the effects of buoyancy during PCM melting. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {We describe a four-probe electrical technique that enables real-time temperature monitoring of the carbon anode in a 53 Ah lithium-ion rechargeable cell during charging and discharging. This technique uses only electrical contacts to the positive and negative terminals of the cell, eliminating the need to insert temperature sensors inside the cell. Our method is based on the intrinsic relationship of anode temperature with phase shift between an applied sinusoidal current and the resulting voltage, valid within the 5{\%} and 95{\%} range of the state-of-charge (SoC) of the cell. Using this technique, we demonstrate that the anode temperature (Tanode) can deviate from the temperature measured at the outside surface (Tsurf) of the cell during charge and discharge. Additionally, we show that anode temperature is primarily determined by entropy change at the anode or by resistive impedance of the anode, depending on the environment temperature (Tenv). ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.

One thing I think is lacking: doesn't account for the fact that the temperature of the cell will be non-uniform when it is self-heated (i.e. hotter near the tabs etc.), whereas when the BITS (as it's so called here) is calibrated (i.e. phase shift at 40Hz is measured), it is obviously at uniform temperature.
Would be interesting to note how maintaining a non-uniform temperature distribution between different parts of the cell (and thus the anode) affect the phase-shift measurement.
Can it be used to estimate the absolute maximum temperature?








How does the phase shift vary with calender/cycle life? I'm sure this has been studied previously in the context of complete impedance spectra.
But perhaps could look at something similar to Bandhaeurs normalisation method.Could I calibrate it at several instances in its life.








Cell internal temperature did not reach thermal equilibrium in any of these examples...








Would be nice to compare predictions with results from Forgez (average value of T of the anode/separator, electrolyte/cathode ensemble)
If I could do this, then I could calibrate it against measured internal temperatures during use, which would be much more useful! (i.e. could I track maximum anode temperature rather than average anode T)








Could I improve precision/accuracy by taking value at 40Hz and another frequency in the 40 - 500 Hz range. I.e. could I compromise between whats done here, and extensive EIS ewith model fitting.








Could I quantify the variance of SoC with temperature. Perhaps have more than one 'look up table'. This will increase computation effort but possible improve accuracy. To make this method applicable on smaller batteries, improved accuracy is a must

Such usage makes the use of batteries in multi-cell configurations to meet voltage, power, and energy demands in a very stressful manner. Thus, effective management and control of a battery system to allow efficient, reliable, and safe operation becomes vital, and diagnostic and prognostic tools are essential. Yet, developing these tools in practical applications is new to the industry, difficult and challenging. Here we present a novel mechanistic model that can enable battery diagnosis and prognosis. The model can simulate various "what-if" scenarios of battery degradation modes via a synthetic approach based on specific electrode behavior with proper adjustment of the loading ratio and the extent of degradation in and between the two electrodes. This approach is very different from the conventional empirical ones that correlate the cell parameters (such as impedance increases) with degradation in capacity or power fade to predict performance and life. This approach, with mechanistic understanding of battery degradation processes and failure mechanisms, offers unique high-fidelity simulation to address path dependence of the battery degradation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The reaction kinetics for the electrochemical insertion-extraction of lithium into and out of graphite and the electrode intrinsic resistance have been studied using galvanostatic intermittent titration with applied microcurrent pulses (GIT), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and in situ intrinsic (i.e. physical) resistance measurements. The formation of a so-called solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) or `passivation layer' on the graphite surface at about +0.8 V versus Li+/Li increases the total intrinsic resistance within the electrode on the first cycle. The gradual growth (i.e. change in volume) of the SEI film during repeated lithium insertion-extraction results in a continued increase in intrinsic resistance. The good agreement between EIS and in situ intrinsic resistance measurements indicates that the latter is a simple and powerful method for investigating the change in this parameter for graphite electrodes. GIT showed a gradual increase in kinetic rate in an initial single-phase region, followed by a decrease in a two-phase transformation region, which was in turn followed by an increase in kinetic rate in a second single-phase region. This is explained by a shrinking unreacted core model. The controlling step of lithium insertion-extraction during the two-phase transformation region was investigated by EIS and GIT.},

@article{foster,
abstract = {This study is concerned with modeling detrimental deformations of the binder phase within lithium-ion batteries that occur during cell assembly and usage. A two-dimensional poroviscoelastic model for the mechanical behavior of porous electrodes is formulated and posed on a geometry corresponding to a thin rectangular electrode, with a regular square array of microscopic circular electrode particles, stuck to a rigid base formed by the current collector. Deformation is forced both by (i) electrolyte absorption driven binder swelling, and; (ii) cyclic growth and shrinkage of electrode particles as the battery is charged and discharged. The governing equations are upscaled in order to obtain macroscopic effective-medium equations. A solution to these equations is obtained, in the asymptotic limit that the height of the rectangular electrode is much smaller than its width, that shows the macroscopic deformation is one-dimensional. The confinement of macroscopic deformations to one dimension is used to obtain boundary conditions on the microscopic problem for the deformations in a 'unit cell' centered on a single electrode particle. The resulting microscale problem is solved using numerical (finite element) techniques. The two different forcing mechanisms are found to cause distinctly different patterns of deformation within the microstructure. Swelling of the binder induces stresses that tend to lead to binder delamination from the electrode particle surfaces in a direction parallel to the current collector, whilst cycling causes stresses that tend to lead to delamination orthogonal to that caused by swelling. The differences between the cycling-induced damage in both: (i) anodes and cathodes, and; (ii) fast and slow cycling are discussed. Finally, the model predictions are compared to microscopy images of nickel manganese cobalt oxide cathodes and a qualitative agreement is found.},

abstract = {Many different battery technologies are available for the applications which need energy storage. New researches are being focused on Lithium-based batteries, since they are becoming the most viable option for portable energy storage applications. As most of the applications need series battery strings to meet voltage requirements, battery imbalance is an important matter to be taken into account, since it leads the individual battery voltages to drift apart over time, and premature cells degradation, safety hazards, and capacity reduction will occur. A large number of battery equalization methods can be found, which present different advantages/disadvantages and are suitable for different applications. The present paper presents a summary, comparison and evaluation of the different active battery equalization methods, providing a table that compares them, which is helpful to select the suitable equalization method depending on the application. By applying the same weight to the different parameters of comparison, switch capacitor and double-tiered switching capacitor have the highest ratio. Cell bypass methods are cheap and cell to cell ones are efficient. Cell to pack, pack to cell and cell to pack to cell methods present a higher cost, size, and control complexity, but relatively low voltage and current stress in high-power applications.},

It is first demonstrated that the widely used mathematical formulation of the model leads to a physical error when the double layer capacitance is included, and a new formulation free of this error is proposed.

abstract = {Renewable power plants must comply with certain codes and requirements to be connected to the grid, being the ramp rate compliance one of the most challenging requirements, especially for photovoltaic or wind energy generation plants. Battery based energy storage systems represent a promising solution due to the fast dynamics of electrochemical storage systems, besides their scalability and flexibility. However, large-scale battery energy storage systems are still too expensive to be a mass market solution for the renewable energy resources integration. Thus, in order to make battery investment economically viable, the use of second life batteries is investigated in the present work. This paper proposes a method to determine the optimal sizing of a second life battery energy storage system (SLBESS). SLBESS performance is also validated and, as an ultimate step, the power exchanged with the batteries is calculated during one-year operation. The power profile obtained is further used to define the cycling patterns for laboratory testing of second life batteries and to study their ageing evolution when used for the power smoothing renewable integration application. Real photovoltaic energy generation data from a Spanish plant was used for the study.},

abstract = {Turbocharged diesel engines are widely used in off-road applications including construction and mining machinery, electric power generation systems, locomotives, marine, petroleum, industrial and agricultural equipment. Such applications contribute significantly to both local air pollution and CO2 emissions and are subject to increasingly stringent legislation. To improve fuel economy while meeting emissions limits, manufacturers are exploring engine downsizing by increasing engine boost levels. This allows an increase in IMEP without significantly increasing mechanical losses, which results in a higher overall efficiency. However, this can lead to poorer transient engine response primarily due to turbo-lag, which is a major penalty for engines subjected to fast varying loads. To recover transient response, the turbocharger can be electrically assisted by means of a high speed motor/generator. When the engine load is increased, the electrical machine acts as a motor to accelerate the turbocharger so that the torque demand can be met rapidly. Conversely, when boost delivery exceeds demand the electrical machine can act as a generator to recover energy that would otherwise be wastegated. This paper presents a model for the transient response of the electrically-assisted turbocharged engine when subjected to a step increase of torque demand. The base model is representative of a 7-litre turbocharged intercooled diesel engine and has been implemented in Matlab-Simulink and calibrated against test bed data. The model is used for the analysis of the dynamic behaviour of the engine with different levels of electric assist to the turbocharger. The results show that while turbocharger response improves with electric assist, compressor surge can occur in generating mode and that limitations on electric assist power are present.},

abstract = {We investigate the robustness of consensus protocols on sensor networks to different types of feedback delays. We provide set-valued conditions for consensus of linear Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) with nonidentical agent dynamics and heterogeneous delays. These conditions consider different feedback delay configurations and are robust and scalable to unknown, arbitrary large topologies and unknown but bounded self-delays and communication delays. Moreover, we provide consensus conditions for relative degree two MAS with different feedback delays in order to illustrate the applicability of these set-valued conditions.},

@article{Hu2012a,
abstract = {State-of-charge (SOC) and capacity estimation plays an essential role in many battery-powered applications, such as electric vehicle (EV) and hybrid electric vehicle (HEV). However, commonly used joint/dual extended Kalman filter (EKF) suffers from the lack of accuracy in the capacity estimation since (i) the cell voltage is the only measurable data for the SOC and capacity estimation and updates and (ii) the capacity is very weakly linked to the cell voltage. The lack of accuracy in the capacity estimation may further reduce the accuracy in the SOC estimation due to the strong dependency of the SOC on the capacity. Furthermore, although the capacity is a slowly time-varying quantity that indicates cell state-of-health (SOH), the capacity estimation is generally performed on the same time-scale as the quickly time-varying SOC, resulting in high computational complexity. To resolve these difficulties, this paper proposes a multiscale framework with EKF for SOC and capacity estimation. The proposed framework comprises two ideas: (i) a multiscale framework to estimate SOC and capacity that exhibit time-scale separation and (ii) a state projection scheme for accurate and stable capacity estimation. Simulation results with synthetic data based on a valid cell dynamic model suggest that the proposed framework, as a hybrid of coulomb counting and adaptive filtering techniques, achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than joint/dual EKF. Results of the cycle test on Lithium-ion prismatic cells further verify the effectiveness of our framework. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Hande2006,
abstract = {A technique has been developed to estimate the internal battery temperature (Tbat) of secondary batteries by measuring the series battery resistance (RB) at cold ambient temperatures. Tests were performed on both lead-acid and nickel metal hydride batteries at different cold temperatures to obtain useful plots of RB versus Tbat. RB was measured by using a pulse discharge circuit to apply a short-duration current pulse (IB) directly to the battery. The test results indicated that RB not only varies with temperature but also varies with the amplitude of IB. The RB versus Tbat plots were later utilized to predict Tbat from RB during alternating current (AC) battery heating at cold ambient temperatures. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{MACDONALD2005,
abstract = {First, several impedance spectroscopy models found useful for data fitting and interpretation of dielectric- and conductive-system frequency data are briefly summarized and compared. The first of these are the Kohlrausch KD model for dielectric-system response, representing the frequency response associated with stretched-exponential temporal response, and models appropriate for ionically conducting materials. These are the K0 model for fitting and analysis (equivalent to the KD model but applied to conducting situations), and its transform extensions: the original modulus formalism and the important corrected modulus formalism, both involving the basic K1 model, calculated from the K0 model. Also, several approaches to describing and fitting two types of nearly-constant-loss effects in conductive-systems are compared. Finally, previously unpublished comparisons and evaluations of several coupling models and the cutoff model are presented and show that the results of the coupling models are inconsistent and lead to physically implausible high-temperature response. The cutoff model does not suffer from these deficiencies, and, as well, its physical basis is simpler than that of the coupling models. It is concluded, on the basis of both experimental and synthetic data fitting, that for conductive-system situations the corrected modulus formalism approach, with a temperature- and ionic-concentration-independent fractional exponent, ??1C ??? 1 / 3, is the most appropriate model for representing the hopping response of homogeneous materials; an effective-medium nearly-constant-loss model describes such experimental loss data well; and the cutoff model, appropriate in both the time and the frequency domains, should replace all coupling models. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.
